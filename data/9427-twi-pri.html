 </div>
 <p>Having an active two wheeler insurance or bike insurance policy, at all times, is mandatory for vehicle owners in India. Bikes, mopeds, motorcycles, and scooters will have to be insured with a two wheeler insurance policy.
    Without an insurance cover, the financial implications of an accident can cause a significant dent to your hard-earned savings. Hence, it is imperative that you purchase a two wheeler insurance policy and renew it at the end of the policy tenure.
 </p>
 <p>A two wheeler insurance policy offers coverage against losses that you might have to incur in case of an untimely eventuality like an accident, theft of the vehicle, etc. Policyholders can choose to purchase either a third-party liability insurance policy or a comprehensive two wheeler insurance cover. </p>
 <p>Third-party liability insurance policies offer coverage for damages caused to the vehicle or assets of a third party and bodily injuries/death of a third party. Further, third-party liability insurance policies also offer a personal accident cover to the policyholder. Third-party liability insurance policies, however, do not offer an own damage cover to the policyholder. </p>
 <p>For more comprehensive coverage, policyholders can opt for a comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy. Comprehensive two wheeler insurance policies offer a third-party liability insurance cover, personal accident cover, and an own damage cover. </p>
 <p id="Compare_Two_Wheeler_Insurance_Quotes">Any authorised insurance company that is registered under the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has the authority to issue a two wheeler insurance policy. Automobile dealers can also sell motor insurance policies. </p>

 <p>When purchasing a two wheeler insurance policy, you will have to choose between a third-party liability-only insurance policy or a comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy. Listed below are the main features and benefits of each type of insurance cover.</p>
 <h3>Third-Party Liability-Only Insurance Policy</h3>
 <p>A third-party liability-only insurance policy is the most basic type of insurance cover that you can purchase as a vehicle owner. It is also mandatory for vehicle owners to have, at the very least, a liability-only insurance policy at all times. These policies provide coverage if you injure a third party and/or their property/vehicle/assets in an accident. Accidents usually have legal consequences, and your liability-only insurance policy can protect you from expenses that you may have to incur as a consequence. Third-party liability insurance policies also offer a personal accident cover to the policyholder. However, these policies do not cover damage caused to the rider's own vehicle. As per the Motor Vehicles Act in India, it is mandatory for every vehicle to have at least a third-party liability cover.</p>
 <h3>The Coverage provided by a Third-Party Liability-Only Insurance Policy is as follows:</h3>
 <ul>
    <li>Damage caused to a third party's vehicle, assets, or property</li>
    <li>Bodily injury or death caused to a third party</li>
    <li>Personal accident cover for the owner/rider of the vehicle, up to a certain pre-specified sum insured</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Comprehensive Two Wheeler Insurance Policy</h3>
 <p>As the name suggests, a comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy offers the insured member a more enhanced coverage. All comprehensive two wheeler insurance policies come with third-party insurance coverage. In addition to this, comprehensive insurance policies also offer an own damage cover and personal accident cover. Thus, your vehicle is protected not only from accidents but also from natural calamities, man-made events, and theft of the vehicle.</p>
 <p>A comprehensive bike insurance policy provides the following coverage to policyholders:</p>
 <ul>
    <li>Third-party legal liability that covers bodily injury/death of a third party and/or damages to a third party’s assets</li>
    <li>Personal accident cover for the owner/rider of the two-wheeler</li>
    <li>Damage caused to one’s own vehicle due to an accident</li>
    <li>Vehicular damages caused as a result of man-made events.</li>
    <li>Vehicular damages caused due to lightning, fire, earthquake, flood, storms, etc.</li>
    <li>Constructive total loss</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Comprehensive vs. Liability-Only Insurance Cover - Which is better?</h2>
 <p>While purchasing a two-wheeler, you will have to choose between a third-party liability-only insurance policy or a comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy. Either one of these two policies might be the right choice for you based on your requirements and circumstances. In terms of the cost, a liability-only bike insurance policy is usually inexpensive when compared to a comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy. While a comprehensive insurance policy might be slightly more expensive to purchase, it is important to note that the coverage offered by this policy is also higher.</p>
 <p>With a third-party liability-only insurance policy, if you meet with an accident and your vehicle is damaged, your liability-only policy will not cover the related expenses. You will have to repair your vehicle and bear the costs on your own. However, if the damage is caused to a third party's vehicle, your liability-only insurance policy will cover the resulting expenses. On the other hand, a comprehensive insurance offers you more enhanced coverage.</p>
 <p>When purchasing a bike insurance policy, most people opt for a liability-only insurance policy simply because it is the cheaper of the two, without considering the inclusions and exclusions of each type of policy. A comprehensive two wheeler insurance plan offers extensive coverage, and it is usually better to have a policy that offers a larger coverage than meet with an unfortunate situation and then deal with financial troubles.</p>
 <p>While it is necessary to consider the factors mentioned above, you must also take into consideration your lifestyle and needs. If you use your two-wheeler very minimally, you can get away with purchasing only a third-party liability insurance policy. Similarly, if you are sure that you will be able to pay for all the expenses that you may have to incur if you happen to meet with an accident, you can again opt for a third-party liability-only policy and pay a lower premium. However, if you frequently use your two-wheeler, it is advisable to purchase a comprehensive bike insurance policy.</p>

 <h2>Documents Required To Apply For A Bike Insurance Policy</h2>
 <p>Purchasing a bike insurance policy is a fairly easy process that doesn't require extensive documentation and paperwork. The documentation process varies from insurer to insurer, and you will have to go through your policy brochure for more information. At the most, you insurer may ask you to submit the following documents:</p>
 <ul>
    <li>Valid Photo ID Proof, such as Passport, Aadhaar card, PAN card, Voter's ID, etc.</li>
    <li>Valid Address Proof, such as Passport, Utility bills, etc.</li>
    <li>Valid Driving Licence copy</li>
    <li>Proof of work experience (if applicable)</li>
    <li>Landline number</li>
    <li>Vehicle registration number and RC certificate</li>
 </ul>
 <p>If you are renewing your policy, you may also have to additionally submit your existing policy copy or policy number. For policies purchased online, the documents required are minimal or nil.</p>
 <h2>Factors Affecting Bike Insurance Premiums</h2>
 <p>When comparing between various bike insurance policies in the market, one of the deciding factors is usually the rate of premiums. It is vital that you choose an insurance policy with an affordable premium, so you don't have any difficulty in paying the amount. Thus, it is necessary that you know exactly what factors will affect your premium.</p>
 <table class="table table-curved">
    <tbody>
       <tr>
          <td><strong>Condition and Type of Vehicle</strong></td>
          <td>The premium may vary based on the condition of your vehicle, the cubic capacity of the engine, the year of manufacture, make of the vehicle, the vehicle's showroom price, etc. Hence, you will have to furnish the correct details at the time of purchasing your policy to obtain an accurate quote</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
          <td><strong>Add-On Covers</strong></td>
          <td>If you will be opting for additional riders or covers at the time of your policy purchase, your premium will also increase accordingly. Hence, opt only for the covers that you require and make sure to account for an increase in premium.</td>

       <tr>
          <td><strong>Coverage Type</strong></td>
          <td>The type of coverage that you choose will play a big role in deciding your premium. While it is mandatory for all vehicle owners to at least have a third-party liability-only cover, it is a good idea to purchase a comprehensive cover for wider protection. The premium payable for a third-party liability-only cover will usually be lesser than that of a comprehensive insurance policy .</td>
       </tr>
       <tr>
          <td><strong>Policy Buyer's Demographics</strong></td>
          <td>Insurers also take into consideration the policy buyer's age, gender, years of riding experience, etc. If you are relatively young with about 5-10 years of riding experience, your premium is likely to be lesser than that of an individual who has just started riding. Similarly, if you can prove a good riding history to your insurer, your premium may be lesser, as well.</td>

          <td><strong>Previous Claims</strong></td>
          <td>
             <p>When renewing a policy or purchasing a fresh policy, insurers are likely to look into your history of making claims. If you had a claim-free year, you may be eligible to receive a discount on the premium for the following year. Similarly, if you made many claims in the past years, your premium may be increased.</p>

    Ways to Reduce your Bike Insurance Premium
 </h2>
 <div class="col-md-4 pull-right">
    <img class="img-responsive lazy" src="/images/india/infographic/how-to-choose-the-best-bike-insurance-policy-2.png" title="How to choose best bike insurance policy" alt="Bike Insurance Policy Benefits" style="display: block;">
    <figcaption align="center"><strong>Two Wheeler Insurance Policy</strong></figcaption>
 </div>
 <p>In India, commuting by a two wheeler is the most time-efficient and cost-efficient mode of transport. While two-wheelers are the best way to commute and people rush to purchase a two wheeler as soon as they can, law has also made it mandatory for bike owners to purchase a bike insurance policy. Despite this, many people simply don't buy a two wheeler insurance policy since they think it is too expensive or not worth it. However, you must remember that having an active bike insurance policy is vital, especially in times of peril. If the cost of your policy is a concern, there are several way through which you can reduce your premium payable. </p>
 <ul>
    <li>
       <strong>Maintain a Clean Riding Record</strong>: Insurers usually evaluate their risk before fixing a premium. Individuals who have a clean riding record with no major accidents or violations of traffic regulations are more likely to get a lower premium amount.
    </li>
    <li>
       <strong>Type of Policy: </strong>Your premium will directly correspond to the type of policy you have. A third-party liability-only policy will have a lower premium than a comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy. However, the lower premium comes with a price. Third-party liability policies are not as exhaustive as comprehensive insurance policies. Hence, opt for a policy that fits your budget and your coverage needs.
    </li>
    <li>
       <strong>Add-On Covers and Riders: </strong>Insurance companies offer individuals the option to buy several add-on covers. You could purchase a zero depreciation cover, a personal accident cover, a cover to protect the pillion rider, a cover for accessories, etc. While it might seem tempting to enhance your basic policy, it is best if you only purchase those covers and riders that you absolutely require, since purchasing additional covers can increase your premium significantly.
    </li>
    <li>
       <strong>Long-Term Policy Discount: </strong>Many insures offer insurance plans with policy tenures of 2 and 3 years. If you purchase a long-term policy and pay your premium as a one-time instalment, you may be eligible to claim a long-term policy discount. Further, purchasing a long-term policy is also a smart way to protect yourself from third-party premium rates hikes. The third-party premium rate is fixed by the IRDAI (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority in India), and they are usually raised every year. Under a long-term policy, third-party premium rates will remain frozen for the duration of the policy tenure, thus guaranteeing a lower premium payment.
    </li>
    <li>
       <strong>Purchasing Policies from the same Insurer: </strong>If you are purchasing an insurance policy from one insurer, it is a good idea to also purchase other insurance policies from the same insurer. Insurers, most often, give an additional discount on the total premium to individuals who have purchased more than one insurance policy from them as a way of rewarding their loyalty.
    </li>
    <li>
       <strong>Online Purchase: </strong>While purchasing an insurance policy online can be beneficial to customers since it lessens the total paperwork needed and is time-efficient, it may also give you additional discounts on your premiums. Some insurance companies will give you a certain discount if you purchase your two-wheeler insurance through their official website.
    </li>
    <li>
       <strong>Your Choice of Two-Wheeler: </strong>If you have purchased a luxury sports bike or a brand new imported bike, your insurer is likely to charge you more as premium since the cost for repair will be significantly more. However, if you purchase a standard bike with not too many frills included, your insurer may offer you a more competitive premium rate.
    </li>
    <li>
       <strong>Compare between Insurers: </strong>Different insurance companies will provide you a different quote based on their coverage, their inclusions, exclusions, etc. It is vital that you compare between insurers and find a policy that has affordable premium payments.
    </li>
    <li>
       <strong>Avoid Filing Claims for Small Damages: </strong>If you file a claim every small damage that occurs to your vehicle, your no-claim bonus could become nil. You will only be awarded a no-claim bonus if you don't make any claims during the policy tenure. Your no-claim bonus is instrumental in helping you secure a lower premium for the following year. Hence, If the damages are small and barely noticeable, get it fixed yourself and don't file a claim for the same.
    </li>
    <li>
       <strong>Discounts based on Age and Experience: </strong>Insurers often look at the number of years you have been riding a two wheeler before fixing your premium. A young, inexperienced rider comes with more risk than a middle-aged, experienced rider. For this reason, ensure you show your insurer your number of years of riding experience and your current age. If these factors are in your favour, they will help you secure a lower premium.
    </li>
 </ul>
 <p id="twirate">In India, at least 70% of the vehicles do not have a motor insurance, and one of the reason is because it has high premium. The IRDAI however has regulated that every two-wheeler has to have a minimum third-party liability cover to at least pay for the damages he/she causes. But there are ways to reduce the premium amount and you can enjoy complete benefits of two wheeler insurance.</p>

 <h2>Insured Declared Value:</h2>
 <p>The Insured Declared Value is basically the current market price of the two-wheeler. The Insured Declared Value (IDV) reduces with the age of the two-wheeler and the depreciation factor. When a policyholder makes a claim, the coverage that is extended by the insurance company is based on the depreciation factor of the two-wheeler or in other words, the age of the vehicle. The claim amount will be only up to the Insured Declared Value of the car and if by chance the cost for the damages is over and above the IDV, then the policyholder has to meet the expenses from his/her own pocket. To negate this loss, policyholders can opt for the zero depreciation cover. </p>
 <h3>Calculation of IDV: </h3>
 <p><strong>IDV = (Manufacturer's listing price - Depreciation)   (Accessories and extra fittings if any - depreciation)</strong></p>
 <p><strong>IDV rate percentage based on Ex-showroom price and vehicle's age:</strong></p>

 <h3>Cashless Claims</h3>
 <p>If you opt for a cashless claims, you will not have to bear any out-of-pocket expenses, unless you have opted for a voluntary deductible. In order <u>to avail the cashless facility</u>, you will have to follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
 <ul>
    <li>You will first have to intimate your insurer of the accident on the toll-free number provided to you.</li>

    <li>The network garage will release your two wheeler after collecting a Satisfaction Voucher from you. </li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Reimbursement Claims</h3>
 <p>In times of emergency, people find it hard to opt for cashless facility. An accident may happen anywhere and at any time, and it might not always be possible or feasible for you to go looking for a network garage. During such times, it is simply more convenient to raise a reimbursement claim instead of a cashless claim. If you opt for a reimbursement claim, you will have to pay for the repair costs on your own. Once you file the claim, the insurance company will pay you back for the expenses you incurred, provided it falls within the predefined limits set by the insurer. In order to file a reimbursement claim, you will have to follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
 <ul>
    <li>Firstly, you will have to notify the insurer of the upcoming claim as soon as possible. Most insurers have a toll-free number or a dedicated email ID. The customer service executive will provide you a claim registration number.</li>

    <li>You can then send your vehicle to the garage. You will need to submit all the required documents to the garage.</li>
    <li>A surveyor will conduct a survey of your vehicle at the garage, and review all your documents.</li>
    <li>The insurer will issue a work order to the garage only after this.</li>
    <li>The repair costs bill will have to be given to the insurer along with the signed Satisfaction Voucher.</li>
    <li>If everything is in order and has been approved, you will receive a reimbursement for your expenses.</li>
 </ul>
 <h3>Constructive Total Loss</h3>
 <p>When you purchase a two wheeler insurance plans, the insurer will fix an IDV or Insured Declared Value. The IDV is considered as the sum insured for your two wheeler insurance, and this is the maximum amount that the insurer will be liable to pay you. Anything over the IDV amount will have to be settled by the insured individual. Sometimes, in case of an accident, especially if it's a head-on collision, the 2 wheeler might be completely wrecked. The cost of repairing such a vehicle might be more than the cost of purchasing the same model in the current market. During such times, your insurer may notify you that the cost of repairing your bike is more than the current cost of the two wheeler or more than the IDV. If the cost of repairing your bike is over 75% of the Insured Declared Value, it is considered to be a Constructive Total Loss. If this is the case, your insurer will pay you the IDV amount after taking depreciation into account.</p>
 <h3>Claim Settlement Ratio</h3>
 <p>The claim settlement ratio (CSR) refers to the total number of <strong>bike insurance claims</strong> that have been settled by the insurer in a particular financial year against the total number of claims they received during the same year. The higher an insurance company's claim settlement ratio is, the better are the company's chances of attracting policy buyers. The insurer's claim settlement ratio should be one of the deciding factors before purchasing a policy. A high claim settlement ratio is a good indication that you won't have to face any undue hassles to receive the claim. A higher claim settlement ratio is also a good indication of customer satisfaction. </p>
 <p>A low claim settlement ratio might indicate the company unwillingness to settle claims for a range of reasons, including contractual binding, misrepresentation or mentioning incorrect information by the insured party, or fraud. The claim settlement ratio is reported by every insurance company to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) every fiscal year, which is then published on the IRDAI website. In most cases, you will also find this information on the insurer's website. The CSR is calculated by dividing the claims settled by a company in a year with the number of claims it received, and multiplying this amount by 100.</p>
 <h2>Two Wheeler Insurance Policy Renewal</h2>
 <p>While it is necessary to purchase a bike insurance when buying a vehicle, you must also ensure you renew your policy in a timely manner. In order to claim your no-claim bonus for the previous year, you will have to renew your policy within a 90-day period, post expiry of your policy. If the policy is not renewed within this time frame, your no-claim bonus will lapse. Policy renewal is a hassle-free process, and there are a several channels through which you can renew your policy, such as:</p>

 </div>
 <ul>
    <li>
       <strong>Mode of Payment: </strong>Your mode of payment is simply the frequency of premium payment. In most cases, you will have to pay a one-time premium to the insurer. Generally, the risk cover will not commence unless you have paid the premium in advance.
    </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
    <li>
       <strong>Policy Tenure: </strong>You can choose a policy tenure as per your needs and requirements. You can either opt for a one-year policy tenure option, or choose a long-term policy tenure of 2 or 3 years. Annual policies should be renewed at the end of every policy year.
    </li>
 </ul>
 <p>If buying two wheeler insurance is important and mandatory for two wheelers, making sure it is renewed on time before its expiry date is also important. Driving without a valid license and insurance is an offence and you will be fined for the same if caught by the police in a random checking.</p>
 <p>Instead of renewing it offline by going to the insurer's office, the digital era has provided the facility to renew two-wheeler insurance policy online within and on mobile apps within few minutes and few clicks. Many insurance companies have mobile apps where you can purchase or renew your two-wheeler insurance policy. So while you are travelling to work, or not in station to go to the insurer's office to renew the policy, you can always complete the process on mobile if you have the insurer's app. </p>
 <p>There is no need of vehicle inspection by any surveyor if you are renewing it on mobile app, you can do it anywhere anytime with few details like vehicle registration number, policy details, DL and other details. Once you make the payment, the insurer will immediately send you renewed policy via email. You can also download the document on mobile app as well. So download your insurer's app today and free yourself from the tedious process of renewal. </p>

 <h3>Tips to Save Money on Two Wheeler Insurance Renewal</h3>
 <p>Since having a two wheeler insurance policy is mandatory according to the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, many of us renew our two wheeler insurance policies without giving it much thought. However, given that this is a frequent expense for many of us, there are certain things that you should consider before renewing your policy if you wish to save your hard-earned money. Thus, we have listed down a few tips to help you reduce your payable premium when renewing your two wheeler insurance policy:</p>
 <ul>
    <li><strong>Don’t Raise Small Claims During the Policy Tenure</strong>: While the purpose of a two wheeler insurance policy is to provide you coverage against damages, it is, in fact, advisable to not raise claims with the insurance company for small damages. If you don’t raise any claims during the policy year, you will receive a No Claim Bonus from the insurer. This bonus can reduce your payable premium for the next policy year. Thus, it is necessary to only raise claims for damages that are expensive to fix. </li>
    <li><strong>Avoid Performance and Aesthetic Modifications</strong>: While it might be tempting to get modifications done to your two-wheeler to increase its visual appeal and performance, you should refrain from doing so if you want to secure a low premium rate. In most cases, insurance companies charge a higher premium for bikes that have been modified since performance modifications increase the chances of an accident occurring, while visual modifications make the bike more prone to theft. </li>
    <li><strong>Install Security/Anti-Theft Devices</strong>: Insurance companies offer an additional discount to policyholders who have installed security devices or anti-theft devices to reduce chances of the bike or its parts getting stolen. Thus, if you want to pay a lower premium, make sure to get anti-theft devices that are approved by the Automobile Research Association of India (ARAI) installed on your vehicle. </li>
    <li><strong>Join the Automobile Association of India</strong>: Individuals who are members of the Automobile Association of India are offered an additional discount by motor insurance companies. Thus, to secure a low premium rate on your two wheeler insurance policy, you should consider joining the Automobile Association of India. </li>
    <li><strong>Reconsider Your Choice of Add-Ons</strong>: Before you renew your bike insurance policy, make sure to reconsider your choice of add-ons. If you had previously chosen a number of add-ons but find that you don’t need the additional coverage provided by certain add-ons, make sure to not opt for them at the time of renewing your policy. </li>
    <li><strong>Compare two wheeler insurance Policies</strong>: Given how easy it is to switch motor insurance companies, it is a must for you to compare various bike insurance covers that are offered by two wheeler insurance companies in India before you renew your policy. Comparing a few different policies will help you decide if you want to continue with your current two wheeler insurance provider. You can also use the bike insurance premium calculator tool, which you will find on the official websites of insurance companies, to get an estimate of the premium charged by various insurance providers. In case you find that another insurance company is offering the same or better coverage at an affordable premium rate, you can choose to switch your motor insurance provider. </li>
    <li><strong>Renew Your Policy Before the Expiry Date</strong>: As a policyholder, it is a must for you to renew your two wheeler insurance policy on time to receive continuous coverage. If your policy has been lapsed for over 90 days, you will lose the accrued No Claim Bonus, thus having to pay a higher premium for the policy. For this reason, it is advisable to set up an automatic reminder facility that will notify you when your two wheeler insurance renewal date is nearing. </li>
 </ul>
 <p>Renewing your two wheeler insurance policy is a hassle-free process that you can do through either online or offline channels. Make sure to keep information about your vehicle and current policy handy when renewing your insurance policy. Lastly, before renewing the policy, make sure to read the fine print of the policy to ensure that you are well aware of the policy’s terms and conditions. </p>
 <h3>How Long Is Two Wheeler Insurance Valid After Renewal Expiry Date?</h3>
 <ul>
    <li>It is ideal to renew the two wheeler insurance policy well in advance to the expiry dates. </li>
    <li>A two wheeler insurance policy will not be valid if it has lapsed.</li>
    <li>The insurer will provide time upto 30 days which is called as grace period, for the renewal.</li>
    <li>If the bike insurance policy has lapsed for more than 90 days,   the renewal policy will be considered as new policy and you do not have to provide old policy details. </li>
    <li>If you renew within 90 days after the expiry, as a result the premium amount will be increased.</li>

                   <p>While it is mandatory for vehicle owners to purchase a two wheeler insurance policy and renew it regularly, it is also imperative that you understand why these policies are necessary.</p>
                   <ul>
                      <li>A two wheeler insurance policy is mandatory as per the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988. The act requires all two-wheelers that ply in public places to be insured with at least a basic third-party liability insurance policy, if not a comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy. </li>
                      <li>The third-party liability insurance policy offers coverage against damages caused to the vehicle of a third party and bodily injury/death of a third party. Thus, you should at least purchase a third-party liability insurance policy, given how they offer you coverage against third-party legal liability.  </li>
                      <li>Both third-party liability insurance policies and comprehensive two wheeler insurance policies provide coverage against personal accidents. Healthcare can be expensive, and your hospitalisation and medical bills, in the event of an accident, could quickly add up to a substantial amount. A bike insurance plan, in such a case, can cover your hospitalisation expenses.</li>
                      <li>Comprehensive two wheeler insurance policies also offer an own damage cover to the policyholder, in addition to providing a third-party liability insurance cover and personal accident cover. Thus, this type of insurance policy will cover damages caused to the vehicle due to natural disasters or man-made circumstances that are out of your control.</li>
                      <li>Comprehensive two wheeler insurance policies cover not only the rider but also the pillion rider, for an additional fee. So, not only will your policy pay for any medical expenses that you may incur as a result of an accident, but it will also provide a cover to the pillion rider.</li>
                      <li>Policy buyers can purchase add-ons along with a comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy for increased coverage. Based on one’s requirements, policy buyers can opt for any of the above-mentioned add-on covers for complete financial protection.</li>
                      <li>Policyholders can choose to purchase a multi-year two wheeler insurance policy just to avoid the inconvenience of having to renew their motor insurance policy every year.*Note: Starting from 1 September 2018, all new vehicle buyers are required to purchase third-party liability insurance covers with a 5-year tenure.</li>
                      <li>In most cases, two wheeler insurance policies are quite affordable. Thus, you can receive significant coverage while paying an affordable premium. </li>
                      <li>Insurance firms issuing two-wheeler policies also provide customers roadside assistance facility. Many-a-times, when one is riding in the middle of the night or on highways, it is hard to get any assistance if one meets with an accident or if the vehicle breaks down. If you have a two wheeler insurance policy, all you need to do is contact the insurer and request for roadside assistance. The insurer will arrange for your vehicle to be towed to the nearest service centre or garage.</li>
                      <li>Most motor insurance companies have tie-ups with certain garages, where you can avail cashless services. In this case, your insurer will settle the repair bills directly with the garage. However, you may still have to pay for any inadmissible expenses and the deductible. That being said, getting your vehicle repaired at a cashless garage/network garage can help you lower your out-of-pocket expenses.</li>
                      <li>Having a bike insurance policy will help you ride with a sense of security. Riding a two-wheeler is not the same as driving a car. While it is convenient and saves time, it is also far riskier to ride a two-wheeler. Hence, purchasing a two wheeler insurance plan can provide you with much-needed protection and a sense of safety and security.</li>
                      <li>Several insurers offer additional discounts and bonuses to the policy buyer. Thus, with these bonuses and discounts, you can further reduce your premium payable. </li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>In India, two-wheelers are one of the preferred modes of transport as a result of the convenience that they offer to vehicle owners. That being said, using a two-wheeler also has its own set of risks. When riding on the road, the vehicle owner might be involved in an accident that causes damage to the vehicle and/or bodily injury/death of the co-passenger, the rider himself/herself, or a third party. Further, the accident might also cause damage to a third party’s assets or vehicles.</p>
                   <p>Road accidents are one of the major causes of injury and death across the world, including in India. The incidence of road accidents has increased across the country, with a number of metropolitan cities reporting an increasing number of fatalities due to accidents.</p>
                   <p>Thus, in order to reduce the financial risks that one is exposed to when riding a two-wheeler, it is necessary to purchase a two wheeler insurance policy for your vehicle. For this reason, the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 makes it mandatory for all vehicle owners to purchase, at the very least, an insurance cover that provides third-party legal liability. That being said, you should, ideally, opt for a comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy if you want to secure increased coverage. </p>

                   <h3>Protects your two wheeler:</h3>
                   The first step to protecting your vehicle is to purchase a bike insurance policy. You can either choose to purchase a comprehensive policy or a liability-only two-wheeler insurance policy. Based on the type of insurance policy you purchase, the policy will offer you a range of benefits. Comprehensive bike insurance policies will cover any damage that occurs to your bike. The policy will cover loss of the vehicle or theft of the whole vehicle or parts of it.
                   <p>Further, the policy will also provide a cover against natural calamities, such as fire, flood, storms, cyclones, etc., and man-made activities, such as riots, strikes, burglary, etc. In addition, the personal accident cover ensures that hospitalization expenses will be paid for in case you happen to meet with an accident. Considering how the cost of repairing a vehicle can really add up, it is wise to have an active comprehensive two wheeler policy at all times. Besides the fact that it is mandatory to purchase, a two wheeler insurance policy is a must-have if you want to keep yourself and your vehicle safe.</p>
                   <h3>Provides a cover against third-party accidental death or injury:</h3>
                   Unfortunately, when we meet with an accident, there is a high chance that we might end up injuring someone else also. A third-party liability-only bike insurance policy will ensure that you will be protected if this happens. In case a third-party happens to meet with an untimely death or sustains severe injuries due to an accident caused by you, they can claim a compensation, and the compensation will be covered by your policy. Further, such an event is also likely to have legal consequences. All your legal fees and expenditures will be covered by your policy.
                   <h3>Covers damage to third-party's property and assets:</h3>
                   Again it is likely that in case of an accident, you may end up damaging another's property or assets. Property, in this case, is defined as another individual's vehicle, parts of the vehicle, house, etc. Reimbursing a third-party for damages to their property may be a real hassle, as these are expenses that you don't normally plan for. However, a liability-only two wheeler insurance policy covers the expenses incurred due to damage of a third-party's property, too. As per the norms set by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), damages up to Rs.1 lakh will be covered by your policy. Any damage to the third-party's property or asset beyond this amount will have to be settled by you.
                   <h3>Covers Damage caused to Vehicles: </h3>
                   A third-party liability-only bike insurance policy will only cover any damage that is caused to the third-party's vehicle, whereas a comprehensive policy will cover damages caused to your own vehicle, as well. Further, damage to your vehicle due to man-made and natural calamities will also be covered. However, you will have to note these will have to come under the limits that are specified by the insurer. If your claim amount exceeds your cover, you will have to bear a portion of your bill.
                   <h3>Cashless Facility at Network Garages: </h3>
                   Most insurance companies have tie-ups with certain garages, called network garages, in various cities across India. Insured members can visit these cashless garages and have their bike repaired or serviced without having to bear the costs themselves. After the repair is done, your insurer will settle the bills directly.
                   <p>However, you will have to remember that not all garages have tie-ups with your insurer. At the time of purchasing the policy, you will be provided a list of network garages. Since this list may be updated with additions and deletion, you will have to look for the updated list on the insurer's website, or you can even call your insurer's toll-free number to locate the nearest network garage.</p>
                   <p>Another thing to remember is that your insurer will only cover repair costs that have been included in the policy. If damage has been caused to a certain part of the two-wheeler that is not covered by the insurer, you will have to settle these bills on your own. Cashless facility at network garages is a huge boon to policyholders since it cuts your expenses significantly.</p>
                   <h3>Covers Non-Vehicle Owners:</h3>
                   Your vehicle may not only be used by you. It is likely that it may be borrowed by family members and friends. Hence, most comprehensive bike insurance policies also extend the cover to any individual riding the vehicle, even if he/she is not the owner. Thus, you can claim a reimbursement/compensation if you meet with an accident, even if the vehicle didn't belong to you, unless otherwise stated in the policy or if the policy comes with a driver's clause.
                   <h3>Personal Accident Coverage:</h3>
                   Comprehensive two wheeler insurance plans will also cover personal accident expenses incurred by the policyholder and the pillion, for an additional fee. Hence you or your nominee can claim a compensation if you meet with an accidental death, permanent total disability, etc.
                   <h3>Add-On Covers and Riders: </h3>
                   Your two wheeler insurance coverage will vary as per the type of policy purchased by you. However, you can always choose to enhance this basic coverage, if your bike insurance provider offers add-on riders/covers. Many insurers offer an additional Nil Depreciation Cover and a Personal Accident Cover for the pillion. While these add-on covers are completely optional, they will make your coverage more inclusive and exhaustive. Ensure you go through your policy brochure or ask your insurance advisor for information on any add-on covers that may be offered by your insurer.
                   <h3>Peace of Mind and Security:</h3>
                   An accident can cause one a significant amount of emotional, physical, and financial distress. While such events are unforeseen and unavoidable in many cases, you can, at the very least, ensure that you are protected by purchasing a 2 wheeler insurance policy. Your bike insurance policy will provide you a range of benefits and help save your hard-earned money in times of emergency.
                   <h3>No-Claim/Cumulative Bonus:</h3>
                   Most insurers offer a no-claim bonus for every claim-free year. This bonus is reflected in the form of lower premiums for the subsequent year. Since your premium amount will usually increase every year due to inflation and rising costs, these discounts can help you can secure a lower premium rate. A no-claim bonus will only be applicable if you renew the policy within the grace period. If the policy has already lapsed, your accrued benefits will also lapse.
                   <h3>Hassle-Free Claim Settlement:</h3>
                   The claim settlement process is usually quick and hassle-free for 2 wheeler insurance policies. In case of an accident or a vehicle breakdown, you can opt for cashless facility at a network garage. Alternatively, you can also choose to pay for the expenses yourself and have the insurer reimburse you for your expenses, after the due verification has been completed. You claim will be settled after you register the claim with the insurer, have the damage evaluated, provide the necessary documents, and do any required paperwork.
                   <h3>Transfer of No-Claim Bonus: </h3>
                   A no-claim bonus is given to you as a reward for riding safely during the tenure of the policy. This bonus can be accumulated for a few years. If you happen to purchase a new 2 wheeler to replace the existing one, you don't have to purchase a new insurance policy. You can simply transfer your policy with the no-claim bonus. The no-claim bonus can help you avail a lower premium rate for the new vehicle. Also, this is applicable even if you are changing insurers. However, you can only transfer the no-claim bonus if the policyholder remains the same. The no-claim bonus that is linked to a policy under one individual's name cannot be transferred to another individual.
                   <h3>Factors Affecting Two Wheeler Insurance Premiums: </h3>
                   There are several factors that can affect the rate of your premiums. Firstly, a comprehensive insurance policy is likely to have a higher premium than a third-party liability-only policy. Insurers will also look at the policyholder's age, work experience, gender, etc. before deciding on a premium amount. Riders with very less experience may be charged a slightly higher premium.
                   <p>Other parameters that will be considered include the age and condition of your vehicle, the year of manufacture, number of kilometres, cubic capacity of the engine, etc. Further, if you choose to purchase an add-on rider or opt for a higher voluntary excess, your premium will also be higher.</p>
                   <h3>Quotes for Two-Wheeler Insurance Policy: </h3>
                   It is imperative that you have an idea of how much you will have to pay as a premium, in order to budget accordingly. It is also a wise idea to compare between quotes from a few different insurers, so you can choose one that is affordable and meets your needs. You can choose to receive a quote for a 2 wheeler insurance policy through offline channels, such as walking into the insurer's office or contacting the Customer Service team, or through online modes. Most insurers offer customers the option of calculating their premium directly on the website. Several third-party websites also have this feature and will also enable you to compare between various insurers. All you need to do is enter a few details about yourself, your vehicle, and the type of coverage you require to receive a quote.
                   <h3>Easy Policy Purchase: </h3>
                   There are several insurers offering bike insurance policies in India. While you can choose to purchase a policy of your choosing through an auto dealer or by directly meeting the insurance advisor, you also have the added option of purchasing the policy online. Several insurers will allow prospective customers and existing policyholders to purchase and renew their policy online, through their official website.
                   <h3>Claim Status: </h3>
                   If you have already raised a claim and are awaiting the settlement, you may want to know the status of your claim. Most insurers provide customers the option to track their claim status through their official website by simply entering the policy number. Hence, this enables you to view all information related to your claims in just a few clicks.

                   <p>The Indian two wheeler industry has seen rapid growth in the past few years. With roads becoming more congested, travel times increasing, and four-wheelers becoming more expensive, two wheelers have truly made things much easier for the Indian commuter. While owning a two wheeler comes with many benefits, you must also invest in a good two wheeler insurance plan.</p>
                   <p>Purchasing a two wheeler insurance plan is mandatory as per the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. If you are purchasing a new vehicle, you may get a two wheeler insurance plan along with it, from the dealer. However, if you are purchasing a pre-owned vehicle, you can either transfer your existing policy or purchase a fresh insurance policy for it, and continue to renew the same at the end of the policy tenure. bike insurance plans do not only cover third-party liability. You also have the option of choosing a more extensive coverage by purchasing a comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy.</p>
                   <p>The Motor Vehicles Act provides the insured member a cover against the various expenses that one may incur due to a road accident. Further, it also provides a cover against any damage that may be caused to your two wheeler due to a natural disaster. Also, legal expenses incurred due to an accident will also be covered. However, you must note that even comprehensive insurance policies come with certain exclusions. For example, vehicle damage caused due to general wear-and-tear may not be covered by most insurance policies. Accidents caused while driving under the influence of alcohol or other narcotic substances will not be covered. Ensure that you go through your policy brochure and make a note of the exclusions, before purchasing your policy.</p>

                   <p>Any individual who owns a two wheeler is required to purchase a two wheeler insurance policy. Most times, when you purchase a new two wheeler, you will receive a motor insurance policy along with the vehicle. The cost of the policy will be built into the cost of the vehicle. However, these policies are likely to be annual policies, and will have to be renewed by you.</p>
                   <p>In order to be eligible to purchase a bike policy, you will need to be a salaried individual, and your minimum salary will have to be over the insurer's pre-defined limit. Further, you will need to ensure that you meet the age limits specified by your insurer. Some insurers may set the minimum age at entry to 18 years, while others may extend it to 21 years. You may also need to have a minimum of one year's work experience and a valid landline number as prerequisites to purchase an insurance policy.</p>

                <div class="panel-body">
                   <p>While several insurers offer two wheeler insurance plans with a policy tenure of 1 year, it is wise to consider investing in a more long-term bike insurance policy. In recent times, insurers have started to offer insurance plans with a <a href="/two-wheeler-insurance/two-wheeler-insurance-for-3-years.html">policy tenure of 2 and 3 years</a>. While it is not mandatory to choose a policy with a longer tenure, and you can opt for a cover that matches your needs, purchasing a long-term insurance policy has its own benefits.</p>
                   <p>Long-term insurance policies offer you the added advantage of not having to renew your policy at the end of every policy year. Instead, you can simply renew the policy once in 2 or 3 years, as per the tenure chosen by you. Several top insurers in India offer long-term motor insurance policies to customers. Policyholders are also given the option to renew these policies through both online and offline channels.</p>
                   <h3>Advantages Of Long-Term Bike Insurance Policies</h3>
                   <ul>
                      <li>
                         <strong>Added Convenience:</strong>While having an active two wheeler insurance is mandatory, several people just forget to renew their policy at the end of the policy tenure. With long-term policies, you don't have to worry about renewing your policy every year. You can simply choose to do it at the end of two or three years, as per the tenure opted for by you.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                         <strong>Fixed Third-Party Premium Rate:</strong>Third-party premium rates are decided by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), and these rates are likely to be raised every year. You will not have to be concerned about this with a long-term policy. Your third-party premium rate is guaranteed to remain constant for the duration of the policy tenure.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                         <strong>No-Claim Bonus Benefits: </strong>For annual policies, if the insured member makes a claim during the policy year, the no-claim bonus will become 0. However, this works a little differently for long-term policies. If you make a claim on your long-term policy, the no-claim bonus will only reduce instead of becoming nil.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                         <strong>Choice of Long-Term Policies: </strong>Many insurers offer customers long-term policies, and these policies can be purchased through online and offline modes. Further, renewing a long-term policy is also extremely easy and most insurers allow policyholders to renew it online by paying the due premium. Given the amount of choice, you can opt for a policy that perfectly matches your needs and comes at an affordable price.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                         <strong>Discounts for Long-Term Policies: </strong>Many insurers also offer you a discount on the total premium when you purchase a policy with a longer tenure. This will enable you to pay a lower premium and save money.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                         <strong>Avoid Risk of Policy Lapse: </strong>For annual policies, policy renewal has to be done every year. If you delay this process by even a few days, you will be subjecting yourself to several risks. On the contrary, with a long-term insurance policy, you won't have to worry about non-renewal risks for the duration of the policy tenure. Further, if you have to renew a lapsed policy, the insurer may ask for the vehicle to be inspected. In case of a long-term policy, you won't have to go through these hassles.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                         <strong>Easy Termination of Policy: </strong>A long-term insurance policy can be cancelled just as easily as an annual two wheeler policy. The premium you paid while purchasing your policy will be refunded to you after deducting the appropriate charge for the number of months that your two wheeler was covered.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                         <strong>Coverage for Co-Passengers: </strong>Not only will a long-term two wheeler insurance policy protect your vehicle and provide a risk cover for you, but it also provides a personal accident cover for co-passengers (for an additional fee, in most cases). This is extremely important as the pillion rider may also be injured when one meets with an accident.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                         <strong>Cashless Garages: </strong>If your two wheeler is in need of repairs or servicing, you can choose to have this done at your insurer's partner garage. Partner garages give you the added benefit of availing cashless facility.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                         <strong>Premium payable under three year cover or long-term for two-wheelers:</strong>As advertised in the name itself, it is a long-term three year insurance cover for a two-wheeler vehicle. The premium is thrice the amount of annual policy premium, but this amount has to be paid in one go. Unlike the annual premium where renewal premium amount is subject to alteration, in long term policies premium once paid ,the amount cannot be altered during the term under any circumstance.

             <div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapseOneOne18" style="height: 0px;">
                <div class="panel-body">
                   <p>If you own a two-wheeler, you are required to have a valid two-wheeler insurance policy, driving licence, and a Pollution under Control (PUC) certificate. Similar to how the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 makes it mandatory for vehicle owners to have a bike insurance policy at all times, getting a PUC certificate for your vehicle is mandatory as per the Central Motor Vehicles Rule, 1989. </p>
                   <p>The Pollution under Control certificate, also known as the PUC certificate, is a certification that is granted to vehicles after the vehicle passes the PUC test. Thus, getting a PUC certificate for your two-wheeler implies that your motorbike or scooter’s emissions are within the specified limits. </p>
                   <h3>Why is it Necessary to Get a Pollution under Control (PUC) Certificate in India?</h3>
                   <p>All motor vehicles that ply the roads, including two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and four-wheelers, can cause air pollution if the vehicular emissions are left unchecked. Thus, in order to ensure that the smoke that is released by motor vehicles is not a threat to the quality of the air in one’s city of residence, it is necessary to check the emission levels of the vehicle.</p>
                   <p>If the emission level is deemed to be safe, a Pollution under Control certificate will be provided to the vehicle owner. There are a number of pollution testing centres that issue PUC certificates for vehicles located all across the country, thus ensuring that vehicle buyers and owners can get a PUC certification for their vehicles with ease. The PUC test is conducted by pollution testing centres at nominal rates that usually range between Rs.60 and Rs.100, based on the type of vehicle that one owns. </p>
                   <h3>Validity of the PUC Certificate</h3>
                   <p>Once issued, the PUC certificate is valid for a period of one year. After the completion of this initial one-year period, you will need to get the PUC test done every 6 months. If the emission reading of your two-wheeler is higher than the approved limit, the PUC certificate’s validity will be decided by the concerned authority based on the test’s reading. If your two-wheeler’s emission levels are extremely high, the PUC testing centre may inform the concerned RTO in your district/city of the same.</p>
                   <h3>Details Mentioned in a PUC Certificate</h3>
                   <p>Certain basic details that are mentioned in the PUC Certificate are as follows:</p>
                   <ul>
                      <li>Licence plate/registration number of your two-wheeler</li>
                      <li>Serial number of the PUC certificate</li>
                      <li>Date of when the PUC test was conducted</li>
                      <li>Pollution under Control test reading</li>
                      <li>The PUC certificate’s expiry date</li>
                   </ul>
                   <h3>Penalties in the Absence of a PUC Certificate</h3>
                   <p>In India, riding a two-wheeler, or any vehicle for that matter, without a valid Pollution under Control certificate is a punishable act, as per Section 190(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Further, the individual riding a two-wheeler without a valid PUC certificate will have to pay a sum of Rs.1,000 for the first offence and a sum of Rs.2,000 for every subsequent offence. </p>
                   <p>Just like your driving licence and the two-wheeler insurance policy, you should also carry your two-wheeler’s PUC certificate with you when riding your two-wheeler. If the concerned authorities stop you and ask you for your vehicle’s PUC certificate, you should be able to produce it immediately if you wish to avoid being fined. </p>
                   <h2>Prescribed Emission Standards in India</h2>
                   <p>All motor vehicles in India are required to meet the emission standards listed below in order to get a PUC certificate for the vehicle:</p>

                   <h3>When Should You Get the PUC Certification?</h3>
                   <p>The PUC certificate should be mandatorily obtained when you purchase a new two-wheeler. PUC certificates, with a one-year validity period, are issued for new two-wheelers. After the first year, you will need to get your vehicle’s emissions tested again and get a PUC certificate via an authorised testing centre. </p>
                   <h3>Where to Obtain a PUC Certificate</h3>
                   <p>A number of petrol pumps across the country have been authorised to conduct Pollution under Control tests. There are also a number of authorised independent testing centres that conduct PUC tests and issue PUC certificates to vehicle owners. </p>
                   <p>Vehicle owners can also obtain PUC certificates from PUC vans that are located on highways. Any licensed auto emission centre that has a computerised facility to check a vehicle’s emissions can issue a PUC certificate to the vehicle owner. </p>

                <div class="panel-body">
                   <p>If you are a two-wheeler owner, it is likely that you have purchased a bike insurance policy for your vehicle. Two-wheeler owners can purchase either third-party liability two wheeler insurance policies or comprehensive two wheeler insurance policies for their vehicles. Most individuals who require enhanced coverage opt for a comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy.</p>
                   <p>A comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy, like the name suggests, provides significant coverage to the vehicle owner against a number of risks including accidental damage to the vehicle, theft of the two-wheeler, third-party liability, etc. That being said, even a comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy has certain limitations. </p>
                   <p>For example, if your two-wheeler gets stolen and the insurance company approves your claim, you will not receive the full purchase price of the vehicle as the claim settlement. What you will receive, instead, is a certain sum of money that has been adjusted for depreciation. Thus, with a comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy alone, you will receive no more than the vehicle’s Insured Declared Value or IDV, which is based on the current market value of your vehicle.</p>
                   <p>In order to remedy this, motor insurance providers offer policy buyers the option to purchase a Return to Invoice Cover along with their policy. Thus, if you have the Return to Invoice Cover and you meet with an accident that is classified as a total loss by the insurer, the insurer will pay you the full invoice price of your two-wheeler.</p>
                   <p>One thing to keep in mind is that the Return to Invoice Cover is not offered to all two wheeler insurance policy buyers. Insurance companies offer this add-on to policy buyers who have new or relatively new bikes. Thus, if your vehicle is many years old, you might not be offered the Return to Invoice Cover since the effects of depreciation can no longer be ignored by the insurance company, at this point.</p>
                   <h3>What is Included under the Return to Invoice Cover?</h3>
                   <p>The Return to Invoice Cover will provide you with coverage against the following events:</p>
                   <ul>
                      <li>Accidents that are classified as a total loss or a constructive total loss (CTL)</li>
                      <li>Theft of the vehicle</li>
                      <li>Loss of the vehicle</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>*Note: Inclusions might vary based on the insurer’s terms and conditions.</p>
                   <h3>
                      What is not Covered under the Return to Invoice Cover
                   </h3>
                   <p>The following instances/events are usually not covered by the Return to Invoice Cover:</p>
                   <ul>
                      <li>If the total loss/theft claim is not admissible under the policy’s coverage, the policy buyer will not receive a claim settlement based on the Return to Invoice cover alone.</li>
                      <li>In case of theft claims, certain insurance providers will not accept the claim unless a final investigation report is submitted to them.</li>
                      <li>The Return to Invoice Cover can also not be used to make two wheeler insurance claims for small accidents and minimal damages. This add-on is only useful in the event of a complete loss or vehicle theft.</li>
                      <li>In most cases, vehicles that are over 3 years will not be covered by the Return to Invoice Cover. </li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>*Note: The exclusions might vary based on the insurer’s terms and conditions.</p>
                   <h3>Who should opt for a Return to Invoice Cover</h3>
                   <ul>
                      <li>Individuals with brand new vehicles or vehicles under 3 years can opt for the Return to Invoice Cover.</li>
                      <li>Individuals who reside in unsafe or theft-prone areas can also opt for this add-on.</li>
                      <li>Anybody who doesn’t have a secure parking facility for their two-wheeler should opt for the Return to Invoice Cover.</li>
                      <li>Those with expensive bikes or sports bikes should opt for the Return to Invoice Cover for additional coverage.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <h3>Things to Remember</h3>
                   <p>As a policy buyer, it is extremely easy to purchase this cover since most two wheeler insurance companies in India offer this add-on to policy buyers who purchase policies directly through the insurer’s office and to those who purchase bike insurance online. Even in case of two wheeler insurance renewal, you can opt for the add-ons that you wish to purchase while renewing the policy. In conclusion, the Return to Invoice Cover is a smart option if you wish to secure complete protection for your two-wheeler. </p>

                   <p>The Zero Depreciation Cover, which is also known as Bumper-to-Bumper Cover, is a popular add-on choice among vehicle owners. Most insurance companies offer this cover in the form of an add-on, and not a separate insurance policy. While a comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy offers an exhaustive coverage, it, too, comes with certain exclusions. Insurers take depreciation charges into account before paying a settlement under comprehensive insurance policies. All these factors might cause you to bear a portion of the expenses on your own.</p>
                   <p>However, with a zero depreciation or bumper-to-bumper bike insurance cover, your insurer will pay you the claim settlement without taking the depreciation factor into account. While purchasing a zero depreciation cover might increase your premium slightly, it is a worthy investment as it guarantees complete peace of mind to the policyholder. Such a cover is especially important if you are purchasing a brand new or very high-end vehicle.</p>
                   <h3>When can you Avail Zero Depreciation Cover?</h3>
                   <p>When purchasing the base two wheeler insurance policy, policy applicants can choose to avail the zero depreciation add-on cover. The zero depreciation add-cover can also be purchased at the time of renewal of the policy. Listed below are the conditions of a zero depreciation add-on cover: </p>
                   <ul>
                      <li>While this differs from one insurer to another, the zero depreciation cover can be availed if the vehicle is up to or less than 2 years old. </li>
                      <li>Policyholders with the zero depreciation cover can avail coverage for the damaged glass, plastic and other consumable parts. </li>
                      <li>In the case of most insurers, the claim amount that a policyholder can avail is between 0%-40% depending on the Insured Declared Value (IDV) or the depreciation factor and age of the vehicle. However, with this cover, policyholders can avail the full claim amount. </li>
                      <li>In the case of most insurers, policyholders are allowed to make 2 zero depreciation claims during the tenure of the policy. In the case of the multi-year two wheeler insurance policy, in most cases, policyholders are limited to just 1 claim a year. </li>
                      <li>The zero depreciation cover is only for select two-wheelers. </li>
                      <li>The zero depreciation cover is not applicable in cases such as mechanical breakdown of the vehicle or to cover the basic wear and tear of the vehicle. </li>
                      <li>Since the zero depreciation add-on cover has to be purchased over and above the premium of the base policy and usually costs 20% of the premium amount of the base policy, this sort of a cover is advantageous for those riding high-end bikes which comes with expensive parts or if the policyholder rides the vehicle through an accident-prone area. </li>
                   </ul>
                   <h3>Features and Benefits of a Zero Depreciation Cover</h3>
                   <p>If you have purchased the zero depreciation cover, your insurer won't take the depreciation of your vehicle into account. This is one of the main benefits of this add-on since the more a vehicle depreciates in value, the lesser you will receive as your two-wheeler claim settlement. </p>
                   <p>Without a zero depreciation cover, your insurer will only pay you the claim amount after considering the depreciation factor. Hence, based on how much your vehicle has depreciated over the years, you might have to incur a significant amount of out-of-pocket expenses. </p>
                   <p>Thus, a zero depreciation cover adds more coverage and protection to your basic plan and makes your policy more inclusive.</p>
                   <ul>
                      <li>This add-on can be purchased when buying a two wheeler insurance policy for the first time or when renewing your existing two wheeler insurance policy.</li>
                      <li>The zero depreciation add-on covers plastic parts, rubber, nylon, and fiberglass components.</li>
                      <li>The standard depreciation percentage for two-wheelers ranges between 0% and 40%. This will be taken into account by the insurer before paying out your settlement. However, with a zero depreciation cover, the policyholder can claim the original invoice amount, excluding the deductible. </li>
                      <li>This add-on can only be purchased for new two-wheelers or two-wheelers under 2 years. Further, certain motor insurance companies might only allow you to purchase this add-on for select vehicle models. </li>
                      <li>Insurance companies might have a limit on the number of claims that you can make per year.</li>
                      <li>The cover cannot be purchased for older vehicles.</li>
                      <li>Normal wear-and-tear, damage caused due to mechanical breakdowns, and events that are not included under the coverage.</li>

                   <p>Policy buyers will have to purchase the zero depreciation add-on cover for an additional premium over and above the premium of the base policy. This add-on is, thus, advantageous for those riding high-end bikes that come with expensive parts or brand new two-wheelers. </p>

                   <p>For most people, purchasing a new vehicle is not just a matter of convenience. The vehicle is also purchased to reflect a part of their personality, and hence one may choose to purchase expensive accessories to enhance the functionality and appearance of the vehicle. The value of different accessories will vary, and it is imperative that you calculate the value of your accessories so you can have them insured and file a claim, when needed.</p>
                   <p>Two wheeler accessories are especially prone to theft, since detaching them and selling them off is quite easy for thieves. Most motor insurance providers in India have add-on covers that will safeguard two-wheeler accessories. However, you will first need to calculate the value of your accessories. You can do this digitally through valuation websites, by finding the current market value of the same accessories, or by talking to auto dealers and accessory dealers. </p>
                   <p>After you arrive at the value of your accessories, you will need to take depreciation into account. Next, you can up the individual value of each accessory to arrive at the total value. Post this, you can contact your insurer and purchase an add-on accessories cover for a particular amount that will provide good coverage to your vehicle accessories even if they are damaged or stolen. If you already have an accessories cover for an amount that's much lesser than the one you just calculated, make sure to contact your insurer and have an endorsement made.</p>

                   <p>It mandatory for all two wheeler owners to purchase at least a third-party liability insurance policy, as per Indian law. If you happen to meet with an accident on the road or if your vehicle is lost or stolen, your insurance policy can protect you financially. The policy will also provide the third-party a compensation for any injury caused to them or damage caused to their property/assets. Hence, if you do meet with an accident and are not able to furnish a valid bike insurance policy to the traffic police, you may be penalized or punished. </p>
                   <p><strong>While the nature and type of penalization may vary based on a few factors, you might have to face one or more of the punishments listed below:</strong></p>

             </div>
             <div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapseOneOne24" style="height: 0px;">
                <div class="panel-body">
                   <p>If you are purchasing a two wheeler insurance policy for the first time, the number of choices, customisation options, industry jargons, etc. can make the task of purchasing a two wheeler insurance policy for your vehicle seem daunting. Thus, we have created a 10-point guide to help you pick the best two wheeler insurance policy if you are a first-time motor insurance buyer:</p>
                   <ul>
                      <li><strong>Get the Right Type of Policy</strong>: Policy buyers can either opt for a third-party liability-only insurance policy or a comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy. The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 makes it mandatory for all vehicle owners to have a third-party insurance cover, although one can choose the comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy if one desires higher coverage. Third-party liability insurance covers provide coverage against third-party legal liability and also provide a personal accident cover to the policyholder. In comparison, comprehensive bike insurance policies provide coverage against vehicle damages/accidents/total loss caused due to man-made/natural calamities and third-party legal liability, in addition to providing a personal accident cover to the policyholder. Thus, you should assess your coverage needs and then pick the right type of two wheeler insurance policy.</li>
                      <li><strong>Compare Policies</strong>: As a first-time policy buyer, it is necessary to not purchase the first insurance cover that is offered to you by your automobile dealer. You should, in fact, do your own research and compare the features and benefits of a few two wheeler insurance policies before picking one policy. </li>
                      <li><strong>Check Premium Rates</strong>: Along with comparing the features of various two wheeler insurance policies, you should also request for premium quotes to get an idea of what is charged for a policy that meets your coverage needs. To check the premium rates, you can either visit the official websites of various motor insurance companies and request for the premium quote or view the premiums for various policies via a trusted third-party insurance comparison website. </li>
                      <li><strong>Read the Fine Print</strong>: Before you select a two wheeler insurance policy for your vehicle, it is necessary for you to read through the policy brochure and the terms and conditions of the policy. Doing so will help you familiarise yourself with the inclusions and exclusions of the policy and any other conditions that you may need to be aware of. </li>
                      <li><strong>Know the Insurer’s Claim Settlement Procedure</strong>: A two wheeler insurance policy is meant to provide a cover against financial risks that might arise in case of an untimely event. Thus, in the event of an accident, vehicular damage, theft, etc., you will need to raise a claim with your motor insurance company. To ensure that you have a seamless claim settlement process, it is necessary to be completely aware of the insurer’s claim settlement procedure and the documents that you will need to submit to raise a claim. Given how important the claim settlement process is, it is recommended that you familiarise yourself with the same before purchasing the policy. </li>
                      <li><strong>Look out for Bonuses and Discounts</strong>: When purchasing a two wheeler insurance policy, it is necessary to check if the insurance company provides any discounts or bonuses. It is also important to know of the bonuses/discounts that you will be eligible to receive in the future. For example, motor insurance companies offer a No Claim Bonus to policyholders who don’t raise any claims during the policy year.</li>
                      <li><strong>Know your Vehicle’s IDV</strong>: Many policy buyers assume that in the event of a total loss, they will receive the complete market value of the two-wheeler as the claim settlement amount from the insurance company. Insurance companies, in fact, will pay you the vehicle’s Insured Declared Value or IDV, at the most. The IDV is determined on the basis of the motorcycle manufacturer’s listed selling price for the two-wheeler at the time of purchasing/renewing the two wheeler insurance policy and adjusting this amount for depreciation. The depreciation percentage to determine the IDV of a two-wheeler is pre-specified for the first five years. After five years, the depreciation rate for the two-wheeler will be mutually agreed upon by the vehicle owner and the insurance company. Thus, it becomes extremely important for you to be aware of your two-wheeler’s IDV to know how much you can expect to receive as the claim settlement from the insurance company. </li>
                      <li><strong>Customize your Policy</strong>: two wheeler insurance companies give policy buyers the option of purchasing add-ons along with their base policy. Some of the add-ons that you can purchase along with your base two wheeler insurance policy are the Zero Depreciation Cover, Personal Accident Cover for Co-Passengers, etc. Make sure to check if you need an enhanced coverage and opt for riders that are offered by the insurance company accordingly. </li>
                      <li><strong>Periodically Evaluate your Insurance Policy</strong>: Your coverage needs and premium payment ability might change over time. Thus, it is necessary for you to periodically evaluate your two wheeler insurance policy and check if it is still meeting your needs. Thus, for example, if you only have a third-party liability insurance cover and feel like you need an own damage insurance cover as well, you can opt for a comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy. </li>
                      <li><strong>Know your Insurer’s Customer Care Channels</strong>: In case of an untimely event, it is necessary for you to immediately inform the motor insurance company about the same. In fact, many two wheeler insurance providers specify timelines within which the policyholder must inform them of the incident to commence the claim process. Thus, make sure to check the various channels through which you can contact your insurance company and keep it handy while riding your two-wheeler. </li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>Make sure to refer to the tips mentioned above to ensure that purchasing a two wheeler insurance policy for your new vehicle is a simple and hassle-free process. As a prospective policy buyer, you can purchase a bike insurance policy of your choice through the official websites of insurance companies, trusted third-party websites that sell insurance policies, or by directly visiting the insurance provider’s office.</p>

                         <strong>Level of Coverage: </strong>Before purchasing an 2 wheeler insurance policy, you will have to decide on the optimum level of coverage for you. You will have to select your coverage type - third-party liability-only insurance policy or a comprehensive insurance policy. Both offer a different type of coverage, with comprehensive insurance policies being the more exhaustive of the two. You will also have to opt for your sum insured. To work out an optimum sum insured, make sure to consider your premium-payment ability, monthly budget and expenses, future liabilities, and the frequency of your two-wheeler usage.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                         <strong>Cubic Capacity of the Vehicle: </strong>Your premiums will be directly tied to the cubic capacity of your bike. A higher cubic capacity will result in a higher premium, and vice versa.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                         <strong>Discounts and Bonus: </strong>Several insurers offer customers discounts and bonuses on their premium. You may be entitled to receive a bonus for every claim-free year or a discount for choosing a long-term policy. Ensure you clarify these with your insurer or the agent.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                         <strong>Add-On Covers: </strong>Most insurers offer customers the option of purchasing add-on covers, such as a Zero Depreciation Cover, Personal Accident Cover, etc. While these add-on covers make a worthy investment, they will also increase your premium amount.

                         <strong>Claim Settlement Ratio and Customer Service: </strong>Before purchasing your preferred insurance policy, ensure you check the claim settlement ratio (CSR) of the insurer. A high CSR is desirable, since it indicates how willing the insurer is to settle the claims. Similarly, look into the insurer's customer service channels. It is vital that you are able to contact the insurer if the need arises, in a hassle-free manner. Thus, it is imperative the insurer is easily reachable at all times.

                   <ul>
                      <li>
                         <strong>Network Garages: </strong>Your insurer will have tie-ups with certain garages in the city. Since these network garages offer you cashless facility, it is necessary that you find out just how large your insurer's network is. The more network garages the insurer has, the better will your choice be. It also ensures that in times of emergency, you don't have to travel too long to get to a network garage. Your insurer will give you a list of network garages while purchasing the policy. You can also view this information on the insurer's official website.
                      </li>
                   </ul>
                   <ul>
                      <li>
                         <strong>Policy Tenure: </strong>Insurers offer bike insurance with policy tenures of 1, 2, and 3 years. It is often more beneficial to purchase a long-term insurance policy than a short-term policy. Consider your needs and check out the various policy tenure options offered by your insurer.
                      </li>
                   </ul>
                   <ul>
                      <li>
                         <strong>List of Exclusions: </strong>Your policy will come with a brochure that details a list of exclusions. Ensure you are aware of the exclusions, so you can be prepared for any eventuality.

                         <strong>Compare between Policies and Premiums: </strong>Insurers offer various plans with varying coverage levels and premiums. Ensure you compare plans of at least a few top insurers before purchasing a policy, so you can get the best deal.

                   <p>Insurance companies usually set the premiums for two wheeler insurance policies based on various factors. However, the premium rates for third-party liability-only insurance policies are set by the IRDAI directly. The insurance company is likely to assess the rider's demographics, such as his/her age, profession, gender, years of riding experience, credit score, etc. Further, details of the vehicle are also taken into account. Your coverage type and inclusion of add-on covers will also play a major role in determining your premium rate. You may also be eligible for discounts or bonus, which will affect your overall premium. </p>

                   <p>In motor insurance, while the majority of the claim amount is settled by the insurance company, a portion of this amount might have to be borne by the policyholder due to the deductible clause in the two wheeler insurance policy. The deductible, also known as excess, is a certain predetermined amount that will have to be paid by the policyholder when the concerned individual is raising a claim. Deductibles can be of two types – voluntary and compulsory. Read on to know more about the difference between the two types of deductibles. </p>

                               <td>All two wheeler insurance policies have a compulsory deductible clause. Thus, for any claim that you raise, you will have to pay a part of the claim amount out of your pocket. The compulsory deductible is a fixed amount that is decided by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) based on the type of vehicle you have. The insurance company, thus, only pays out the claim amount after deducting the compulsory deductible amount from it. Since the compulsory deductible is mandatory for all policyholders to pay, insurance companies do not offer any discount to policyholders for paying this amount.</td>
                               <td>Unlike the compulsory deductible, which is mandatory for all policyholders to pay, the voluntary deductible can be opted by policyholders over and above the compulsory deductible amount. Many policyholders who wish to secure a lower premium from the insurer opt for a voluntary excess. Opting for a high voluntary excess will result in a low premium payable, and vice versa. The amount that you can opt for as the voluntary deductible is usually dependent on the insured declared value (IDV) of your two-wheeler. Further, two wheeler insurance companies in India also give a discount on the own damage premium to policyholders who opt for a voluntary deductible.</td>

                   <h3>When should you opt for a Voluntary Deductible?</h3>
                   <p>Policyholders who are looking to save money on premiums or are extremely confident of their riding skills can opt for a voluntary deductible when purchasing a two wheeler insurance policy. Individuals who very rarely use their two-wheelers can also opt for a voluntary deductible since this will help them secure a lower premium payment. However, you should only opt for a voluntary deductible if you are sure that you will be able to bear your share of the expenses in the event of a claim. </p>
                   <p>Given that you might need to raise a claim with your bike insurance company at the most unexpected of times, you will need to ensure that you always have the sufficient funds in hand since the insurance company will only be paying the claim amount minus the compulsory and voluntary deductible amount. Thus, when purchasing a bike insurance policy or when renewing your two wheeler insurance policy, make sure to assess your budget, premium payment capacity, past claim history,riding skills, and then choose an adequate voluntary deductible, accordingly, if you wish to.</p>

                      <h2>Tips to Save Money on Two Wheeler Insurance Renewal</h2>
                      <p>Since having a two wheeler insurance policy is mandatory according to the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, many of us renew our two wheeler insurance policies without giving it much thought. However, given that this is a frequent expense for many of us, there are certain things that you should consider before renewing your policy if you wish to save your hard-earned money. Thus, we have listed down a few tips to help you reduce your payable premium when renewing your two wheeler insurance policy:</p>
                      <ul>
                         <li><strong>Don’t Raise Small Claims During the Policy Tenure</strong>: While the purpose of a two wheeler insurance policy is to provide you coverage against damages, it is, in fact, advisable to not raise claims with the insurance company for small damages. If you don’t raise any claims during the policy year, you will receive a No Claim Bonus from the insurer. This bonus can reduce your payable premium for the next policy year. Thus, it is necessary to only raise claims for damages that are expensive to fix. </li>
                         <li><strong>Avoid Performance and Aesthetic Modifications</strong>: While it might be tempting to get modifications done to your two-wheeler to increase its visual appeal and performance, you should refrain from doing so if you want to secure a low premium rate. In most cases, insurance companies charge a higher premium for bikes that have been modified since performance modifications increase the chances of an accident occurring, while visual modifications make the bike more prone to theft. </li>
                         <li><strong>Install Security/Anti-Theft Devices</strong>: Insurance companies offer an additional discount to policyholders who have installed security devices or anti-theft devices to reduce chances of the bike or its parts getting stolen. Thus, if you want to pay a lower premium, make sure to get anti-theft devices that are approved by the Automobile Research Association of India (ARAI) installed on your vehicle. </li>
                         <li><strong>Join the Automobile Association of India</strong>: Individuals who are members of the Automobile Association of India are offered an additional discount by motor insurance companies. Thus, to secure a low premium rate on your two wheeler insurance policy, you should consider joining the Automobile Association of India. </li>
                         <li><strong>Reconsider Your Choice of Add-Ons</strong>: Before you renew your bike insurance policy, make sure to reconsider your choice of add-ons. If you had previously chosen a number of add-ons but find that you don’t need the additional coverage provided by certain add-ons, make sure to not opt for them at the time of renewing your policy. </li>
                         <li><strong>Compare two wheeler insurance Policies</strong>: Given how easy it is to switch motor insurance companies, it is a must for you to compare various bike insurance covers that are offered by two wheeler insurance companies in India before you renew your policy. Comparing a few different policies will help you decide if you want to continue with your current two wheeler insurance provider. You can also use the bike insurance premium calculator tool, which you will find on the official websites of insurance companies, to get an estimate of the premium charged by various insurance providers. In case you find that another insurance company is offering the same or better coverage at an affordable premium rate, you can choose to switch your motor insurance provider. </li>
                         <li><strong>Renew Your Policy Before the Expiry Date</strong>: As a policyholder, it is a must for you to renew your two wheeler insurance policy on time to receive continuous coverage. If your policy has been lapsed for over 90 days, you will lose the accrued No Claim Bonus, thus having to pay a higher premium for the policy. For this reason, it is advisable to set up an automatic reminder facility that will notify you when your two wheeler insurance renewal date is nearing. </li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Renewing your two wheeler insurance policy is a hassle-free process that you can do through either online or offline channels. Make sure to keep information about your vehicle and current policy handy when renewing your insurance policy. Lastly, before renewing the policy, make sure to read the fine print of the policy to ensure that you are well aware of the policy’s terms and conditions. </p>
                      <h2>How Long Is Two Wheeler Insurance Valid After Renewal Expiry Date?</h2>
                      <ul>
                         <li>It is ideal to renew the two wheeler insurance policy well in advance to the expiry dates. </li>
                         <li>A two wheeler insurance policy will not be valid if it has lapsed.</li>
                         <li>The insurer will provide time upto 30 days which is called as grace period, for the renewal.</li>
                         <li>If the bike insurance policy has lapsed for more than 90 days,   the renewal policy will be considered as new policy and you do not have to provide old policy details. </li>
                         <li>If you renew within 90 days after the expiry, as a result the premium amount will be increased.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>If you have forgot to renew the two wheeler insurance, here is what you have to do. Insurance companies offer <strong>'Grace Period'</strong>, which allows additional time (usually 30 days) to the policyholder to renew the policy after the renewal due date. If the insured does not renew the policy during the grace period, then the policy will expire or lapse. If he/she renewed the policy after grace period, the insurer is liable to increase the premium amount for cited reasons. </p>
                      <h3>Consequences:</h3>
                      <p>If the policyholder fails to renew his/her two wheeler insurance policy during the grace period, then the policy will lapse. Due to this, the policyholder will then have to go for a reinstatement of the policy. The reinstatement of the policy, depending on how long it has lapsed, will cost the policyholder extra over the premium price and the two-wheeler will have to be inspected by an official. If the policyholder has the no-claim bonus, this benefit might be lost as well and he/she will have to pay the entire premium price. Lastly and most importantly, if the policyholder has allowed the policy to lapse and does meet with an accident, then no claim can be made and if he/she does make a claim, the insurance company will reject it without any hesitation. In other words, the policyholder will have to cover for the damages and medical expenses from his/her own pocket and will have to pay a fine for the lapsed policy. </p>

                <ul>
                   <li>If your policy has expired, you will first need to check if the policy is still within the grace period. If you make the due premium payment within the grace period, your policy will continue as is, with the same benefits, and your accrued benefits will not be lost.</li>
                   <li>If your policy has been expired for a while, you will need to inform the insurer. The insurer may renew your policy after the vehicle is evaluated for damage.</li>
                   <li>If you choose to purchase a policy from another insurer, you will need to immediately contact your previous insurer and request for a no-claim certificate, provided you did not make any claims in the previous year. This no-claim certificate is of utmost importance since it can help you secure a lower premium under the new policy. You can get a no-claim certificate if your policy has been lapsed for under 90 days. If the policy has been expired for over 90 days, your accrued benefits will be lost.</li>
                   <li>Before you can purchase a bike insurance policy from another insurer, you will have to zero-in on a policy that matches your requirements. There are several insurance companies that offer bike insurance plans. You will need to compare between the plans offered by various companies and opt for one that offers a competitive and affordable premium rate with a good amount of benefits.</li>
                   <li>In some cases, your insurer may want you to get your two-wheeler evaluated by a surveyor. This is to check whether there were any problems or pre-existing damages with the vehicle. Your insurer may charge you a certain fee for this process. If the inspection has been cleared successfully, you can proceed to purchase your policy.</li>
                   <li>You can purchase your policy through both online and offline modes. You will need to provide the insurer a few details about yourself, submit the necessary documents, and make the premium payment. Again, you can choose to pay the premium online or offline, by cash, credit card/debit card, net banking, NEFT, mobile wallets, etc. You can choose to purchase a third-party liability-only policy or a comprehensive policy. You also have the option to purchase an annual policy or a long-term policy for 2 or 3 years.</li>
                   <li>You can also choose to customise your policy with add-on covers or additional riders. This will ensure that your policy cover is more exhaustive.</li>
                   <li>As the last step, you will have to remember to renew your bike insurance policy as the date of expiry comes close, in order to enjoy continued coverage and carry forward your accrued benefits.</li>

                <p>It is not uncommon for first-time motor insurance buyers to pick the first insurance policy that is offered to them. Once they have purchased the policy, they might come to realize that they would like a higher or lower coverage or that the premium rate for the policy is too much for the coverage that they are receiving. In such cases, the two wheeler insurance policyholder can choose to change the policy or even the insurance provider, altogether. </p>
                <p>A few reasons why people choose to change their two wheeler insurance provider are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                   <li><strong>High Premium</strong>: Insurance firms consider slightly different parameters when calculating the premium rate that is offered to customers. Thus, while it is not uncommon for two insurance companies to provide you two different premium quotes, the premium rate quoted should still be in the same range. If you find that your insurer is charging you a premium that is significantly higher than what other insurers are charging for a policy with a similar coverage, you should consider switching your motor insurance provider.</li>
                   <li><strong>Customer Service</strong>: Your insurance provider should offer timely customer service in case you need any assistance. If you find that your insurance provider does not clear your queries or does not offer sufficient channels for you to contact them, it is advisable to switch your insurance company. </li>
                   <li><strong>Claim Settlement Procedure</strong>: A two wheeler insurance policy provides you coverage against man-made and natural calamities, third-party liability, accidents, etc., subject to the type of two wheeler insurance policy that you have purchased. Thus, in the event of a vehicular damage, theft, or accident, you, as a policyholder, should be able to raise claims in a hassle-free manner and receive the due settlement in a timely manner. If your two wheeler insurance company takes too long to settle claims or has a complicated claim process, you should consider changing your bike insurance provider. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Policyholders can change their two wheeler insurance provider at any point during the policy tenure. To change your insurance provider before the completion of the policy tenure, you will need to first give your current insurance provider a notice. In most cases, insurance firms will require you to give them at least a 7-day notice, if not more, before cancelling your policy. </p>
                <p>You can also choose to change your insurance provider when your two wheeler insurance policy is due for renewal. Most insurance firms allow prospective customers to renew their two wheeler insurance policy online by keying in a few details, submitting the necessary documents, and then making the due premium payment online. </p>
                <p>Changing your insurance provider is an extremely hassle-free process. However, before opting for a policy that is offered by a different motor insurance company, you should make sure to assess your coverage needs, check the features and benefits of a few different policies, request for online premium quotes, and then purchase the policy if you are happy with the coverage offered and the price that is quoted by the insurer. </p>

                <h3>Things to Consider when Changing your Two Wheeler Insurance Provider</h3>
                <p>Changing your two wheeler insurance provider is an important decision that requires significant thought and research. Before switching your insurance company, make sure to consider the points mentioned below:</p>
                <ul>
                   <li><strong>Don’t opt for a different insurance policy solely based on the price</strong>: You should have a valid reason to change your two wheeler insurance provider. It is necessary to not change your two wheeler insurance policy simply because another insurance company is offering a lower premium. Many a time, a lower premium rate could translate into lower coverage. </li>
                   <li><strong>Check the insurer’s reliability</strong>: Before changing your two wheeler insurance company, make sure to check the new insurance firm’s reliability. You can do this by checking the insurance firm’s incurred claim ratio for the past few financial years, online reviews by other customers, history of the company, customer care channels, network garages in your city of residence, two wheeler insurance renewal process, etc.</li>
                   <li><strong>Compare before you purchase</strong>: In order to find a two wheeler insurance policy that is well-suited to your coverage needs, it is necessary to compare at least a few different policies that are offered by various insurance companies in India. Doing this will give you an idea of the coverage that you can expect and the approximate premium that is charged for a particular type of policy.</li>
                   <li><strong>Understand your coverage needs</strong>: If you are changing your insurance company because you are unsatisfied with the coverage that is offered by your policy, you should make sure to first assess your coverage needs. As a policy buyer, you can opt for a third-party liability two wheeler insurance policy, annual comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy, or a long-term comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy, based on your coverage needs and your premium payment ability.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A good two wheeler insurance policy is a must since it provides you and your vehicle much-needed coverage against accidents, man-made damages, natural calamities, theft of the vehicle, etc., Thus, make sure to do your due research to ensure that you are able to make an informed decision when switching your insurance provider. </p>

                <p>If you are planning to purchase a new two-wheeler and sell your existing vehicle, you don't have to purchase a new insurance policy. You can simply choose to transfer the existing policy. This will help you keep your accrued benefits intact. You will need to ensure that this is done within the stipulated time. You will also have to inform the insurer and request for a no-claim certificate. The no-claim certificate will help you secure a lower premium for the following year.</p>
                <h3>When Should You Transfer Your Bike Insurance Policy?</h3>
                <p>When you are purchasing a new two-wheeler, transferring an insurance policy may not seem very important. However, if you transfer your insurance policy, you won't have to purchase a new policy. Hence, if you've had a claim-free year, you won't have to let that benefit go to waste. You can transfer your policy and still claim the benefits. Similarly, if you have a long-term policy, you will be saving money by transferring your policy and continuing the coverage instead of purchasing another policy.</p>
                <h3>Process To Transfer Your Two Wheeler Insurance</h3>
                <p>In order to transfer your bike insurance, you will first have to transfer the ownership of the two-wheeler from your name to the buyer's name. While the entire process is quite hassle-free, you will have to ensure you submit all the required documents in a timely manner.</p>

                            <td>Firstly, you will have to inform the RTO of the sale. In order to initiate the transfer of your two-wheeler ownership, you will have to give the buyer certain documents, such as the tax certificate, registration certificate, PUC certificate, a copy of the bike insurance policy, a filled and signed Form 28 (for transfer of ownership), Form 29 (no-objection certificate), and Form 30 (report of the transfer). Once you have handed these document to the buyer, you can legally transfer the ownership of your two-wheeler.</td>
                            <td>After transferring the ownership of your two-wheeler, you will have to transfer the insurance policy. In order to transfer the insurance policy, you will have to first inform your insurer and obtain a no-claim certificate. If you do this, your no-claim bonus will continue to remain in your name, and won't get transferred to the buyer of your vehicle. The No-Claim Certificate will help you get a premium discount for the following year. Next, the person who has purchased the insurance plan will also have to visit the insurer and furnish their personal details for the current plan. Lastly, you will have to inform the RTO of the same.</td>

                <h3>Importance Of Transferring Your Motor Insurance Policy</h3>
                <ul>
                   <li>
                      <strong>Freedom from the Buyer's Future Liabilities: </strong>If you fail to transfer your insurance policy, and the individual who purchases your two-wheeler happens to meet with an accident and cause damage to a third-party property or assets with the two-wheeler you sold to them, you will be held liable. While your insurer will still pay off the claim, you will have to face a lot of hassle in ensuring that the claim is settled favourably. Thus, it is vital that you transfer your policy.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                      <strong>No-Claim Bonus: </strong>For every claim-free year, you insurer may reward you with a no-claim bonus. This no-claim bonus can be extremely useful in securing a lower premium for the following year. Transferring your policy will ensure that your no-claim bonus is also transferred. If you fail to transfer your policy, and purchase a new policy instead, your accrued benefits will be lost.

                <p>Knowing what falls under your insurer's exclusion criteria is just as important as knowing the inclusion criteria, as it will help minimise the chances of your claim getting rejected in the future due to non-insurability. The exclusion criteria varies from insurer to insurer and plan to plan. Hence, ensure you go through your policy document carefully to make a note of your plan-specific exclusion criteria.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapseOneOne39" style="height: 0px;">
             <div class="panel-body">
                <p>A number of vehicle owners, even today, purchase two wheeler insurance policies only because the law makes it mandatory for them to do so. However, to make the most of your two wheeler insurance policy, be it a third-party liability-only two wheeler insurance policy or a comprehensive two wheeler insurance cover, it is necessary to first differentiate the facts and the myths that surround bike insurance. Thus, we have listed some of the most popular myths about two wheeler insurance policies below.</p>
                <p><strong>Myth 1</strong>: I don’t need a comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy since only the third-party liability insurance cover is mandatory.</p>
                <p>Although the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 makes it mandatory for policy buyers to purchase at least a third-party liability insurance policy, it is advisable to purchase a comprehensive two wheeler insurance cover if you require a higher level of coverage. </p>
                <p><strong>Myth 2</strong>: I can’t transfer my two wheeler insurance provider without losing the No Claim Bonus</p>
                <p>two wheeler insurance companies in India offer a No Claim Bonus to policyholders who don’t raise any claims during the policy term, in an effort to reward them for their safe riding. If you have received a No Claim Bonus from your present two wheeler insurance provider but wish to transfer your policy to another motor insurance company, it is necessary to remember that your No Claim Bonus can be transferred, as well. Thus, you will not be losing anything by transferring your bike insurance policy to a different insurer.</p>
                <p><strong>Myth 3</strong>: I can’t purchase two wheeler insurance online.</p>
                <p>On the contrary, two wheeler insurance companies in India give policy buyers the option to purchase two wheeler insurance policies through online and offline channels. Thus, while you can always walk into the nearest insurance office and purchase a two wheeler insurance policy for yourself, you can also choose to purchase bike insurance online. One of the key advantages of purchasing two-wheeler  insurance online is that you can first compare two wheeler insurance policies offered by different motor insurance companies and use the two wheeler insurance premium calculator feature, before you pick a two wheeler insurance policy for your vehicle.</p>
                <p><strong>Myth 4</strong>: Pillion riders are covered under my two wheeler insurance policy.</p>
                <p>Most individuals with two wheeler insurance assume that their policy also covers the pillion rider. However, two wheeler insurance policies, regardless of whether it is a third-party liability two wheeler insurance policy or a comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy, do not cover pillion riders. If you wish to extend coverage to the pillion rider, you will need to purchase the Pillion Rider Cover as an add-on. </p>
                <p><strong>Myth 5</strong>: two wheeler insurance is expensive.</p>
                <p>two wheeler insurance is usually not very expensive, especially when you consider the level of coverage that the policy offers. The premium payable usually depends on a number of factors including the age and experience of the policy buyer, the type/model of the two-wheeler, the type of policy chosen, add-ons opted for, etc. In order to ensure that you are getting sufficient coverage for the premium that you are paying, make sure to compare two wheeler insurance policies and check the insurance quotes of various insurance covers before selecting a particular policy.  </p>
                <p><strong>Myth 6</strong>: Comprehensive two wheeler insurance policies cover all damages.</p>
                <p>Contrary to popular belief, comprehensive two wheeler insurance policies do not cover all types of damages. Although the coverage provided by a comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy is extensive, there are certain limitations to the coverage. For example, two wheeler insurance policies do not cover accidents/vehicular damages caused due to drunken driving. Similarly, even if a claim is accepted, the motor insurance provider will only provide a settlement after taking the depreciation of the vehicle into account, unless you have purchased a <a href="/insurance/two-wheeler-insurance.html">Zero Depreciation Cover</a> along with your bike insurance policy.</p>
                <p><strong>Myth 7</strong>: I have to purchase the two wheeler insurance policy that is offered by my automobile dealer.</p>
                <p>No, you certainly don’t have to purchase whatever policy is offered by your automobile dealer. It is, in fact, advisable to do your own research, compare two wheeler insurance policies offered by various insurers, check the features, benefits, and premium quotes of these policies, and then purchase a two wheeler insurance cover for your vehicle on your own. Given how easy it is to purchase bike insurance online and offline, you are not likely to face any hassles when purchasing a two wheeler insurance policy.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, before you purchase a two wheeler insurance policy for your vehicle, it is important to do your due research to ensure that you know all the facts.</p>
                <h2>Safety Tips to Observe while Riding</h2>
                <ul>
                   <li>
                      <strong>Avoid riding under the influence of alcohol:</strong> It is absolutely important that you keep yourself from riding your two wheeler when under the influence of alcohol or other narcotic substances. Alcohol reduces your reaction time greatly, and it also gives you false bravado that might make you do things that you wouldn't normally do. Not only will it cause harm to you, but it may also affect other people on the road for no fault of theirs. Ensure you have an alternate means of transport arranged if you plan to drink.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                      <strong>Wear a helmet:</strong> In India, law has made wearing a helmet mandatory for the rider and the pillion. However, many people still forego the helmet while riding a two wheeler. Ensure you always wear a helmet, even if you are riding only for a short distance. A helmet could be the only thing that keeps an accident from becoming fatal. A helmet with a good face and eye shield is of utmost importance when it comes to safeguarding yourself if you meet with an accident. It is also necessary for pillion riders to safeguard themselves with a good helmet. A protective helmet can prevent critical brain damage and even death.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                      <strong>Avoid distractions:</strong> Many people falsely believe that speaking on the phone or even texting while riding won't impair their judgement or affect their attention. Nothing can be farther away from the truth. Speaking on the phone or not paying sufficient attention to what's ahead can cause even the most experienced riders to meet with accidents. If you need to answer an important call or text, ensure you stop at the road side and do so, and start riding only after you have completed the said task. The same applies to listening to jarring music on your headphone. Distractions may be many, but ensure you keep your eyes on the road to protect yourself and others.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                      <strong>Avoid riding in bad weather</strong>: Riding in bad weather conditions can be quite risky. Heavy rain, fog, mists, and storms can greatly reduce road visibility and cause potential accidents. Slippery roads on rainy days are a major cause for concern since one has to be especially carefully while steering and manoeuvring. Strong gusts of wind can also make it hard to ride. If you do have to ride during bad weather, ensure you ride at a slower pace than usual.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                      <strong>Look out for road hazards</strong>: While potholes and excess sand and debris on the road is rather unpleasant while driving a car, it becomes so much worse if you are riding a two wheeler. Ensure you pay attention to the road ahead, so you can avoid these road hazards in a timely manner. If avoiding them is not an option, make sure you at least slow down so you get more control of your two wheeler.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                      <strong>Follow traffic regulations</strong>: Road safety should not be taken for granted. Traffic rules exist for a reason, and they should be followed by everyone. Don't skip that red light, and don't drive rashly just to save a few minutes. Not only will it make riding more dangerous for you, the rider, but it might also put others at risk. Following specified speed limits, stopping at traffic signals, etc. are a few simple things you can do when you are riding.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                      <strong>Wear the appropriate riding gear:</strong> Ensure to wear the right riding gear before heading out for a long ride. It is essential that you wear protective boots, a good quality leather jacket, gloves, anti-skid shoes, etc. Thus even if you were to meet with an accident or skid on the road, your clothing will help you stay protected and reduce the impact of the accident.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                      <strong>Thoroughly check your two wheeler before riding:</strong> Before riding your two wheeler, ensure you check your vehicle's conditions. Make sure to check the tires for signs of wear, if the brakes are functioning as they should, mirrors, horn, headlights, taillights, and the clutch. Further, ensure that there is no fuel leak and also check the coolant and hydraulic fluid levels.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                      <strong>Take classes and get a licence before you start riding:</strong> Most people don't learn how to ride by enrolling under a formal riding class. Learning how to ride from your friends or through trial-and-error is not the best way to hone your skills. Riding classes will ensure that you know the correct riding strategies and are well-versed with the local traffic laws. You should also ensure that you get a two wheeler licence before hitting the road.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                      <strong>Always stay on guard: </strong>It is wise to always ride defensively, no matter how experienced you are. Watch out for pedestrians, blind spots of other riders and drivers, and ensure you maintain a safe distance from other vehicles. Even when you follow all the necessary traffic regulations, accidents can happen due to somebody else's negligence. Hence, you must always keep your guard up when riding a bike.

                <p>GST or the Goods and Services Tax was implemented on 1 July 2017. While GST has made a few things cheaper and a few things pricier, insurance premiums for bike insurance policies have risen since when it was implemented. The tax slab for the insurance industry has been raised from the previous 15% to 18%, under the GST. This 3% hike in the tax rate has directly affected insurance premiums. Policyholders will now have to slightly more to purchase two wheeler insurance policies, due to the GST. The new tax rates are applicable on purchase of new insurance policies and renewal of existing ones.</p>

                <strong>
                1.What is a deductible? Is it a good idea to opt for a Voluntary Deductible?
                </strong>
                <p>A deductible is a part of the claim that will have to be settled by the insured individual. The insurer will not pay for your share of the deductible. Your premiums are also linked to the deductible. Higher the deductible you opt for, the lower your premium will be. However, opting for a high voluntary deductible is smart only if you are sure that you will be able to pay for your share of the claim.</p>
                <strong>2.What should I do in case I lose my two wheeler insurance policy?</strong>
                <p>If you have lost your two-wheeler insurance policy, the first thing you will have to do is file an FIR at a police station. Next, you can apply for a duplicate insurance policy from your insurer. To do so, you will have to submit a written request along with any supporting documents that may be required by your insurer. Your insurer may also ask you to submit a signed indemnity bond.</p>
                <strong>3.If my two-wheeler is stolen or lost, how much is the insurer liable to pay me?</strong>
                <p>If your two-wheeler is lost or stolen, you are eligible to claim the IDV or Insured Declared Value of the two-wheeler. The IDV will be based on various factors, such as the cubic capacity of the engine, the age of the vehicle, and the geographic location. Also, your premiums are linked to the Insured Declared Value. If your two-wheeler has a high IDV, your premium will be more, and vice versa.</p>
                <strong>4.I have recently modified my bike. Am I still eligible to purchase a two wheeler insurance policy?</strong>
                <p>Yes, you can purchase two-wheeler insurance policies for modified bikes. Your premium amount may increase or decrease based on the type of modifications that are done. If the performance or aesthetics of the bike was modified, your premium may also increase. However, if you modified your two-wheeler to increase the security of the bike, then your two-wheeler insurance premium will decrease.</p>
                <strong>5. What is the importance of an endorsement for two wheeler insurance policies?</strong>
                <p>While purchasing a two-wheeler insurance policy, you are required to provide certain details about yourself and your vehicle to the insurer. If you have provided any wrong information while purchasing the policy, your claim could be denied by the insurer. Hence, if you realise that you have furnished any wrong details, you will immediately have to make an endorsement. Any changes requested by you once the policy has been issued will be incorporated by way of an endorsement by your insurer.</p>
                <strong>6. Can I change my insurer during the policy term?</strong>
                <p>Yes, you can port your insurance policy anytime. However, you will have to ensure that you notify your current insurer of your wish to port the policy and submit a written request 45 days before the expiry of the policy. Post this, you can port the policy to a different insurance company, and the accrued benefits will also be transferred.</p>
                <strong>7. Do long-term two wheeler insurance policies come with any exclusions?</strong>
                <p>While the exclusion criteria will vary from insurer to insurer, a few general exclusions for long-term two-wheeler insurance policies are:</p>
                <ul>
                   <li>Wear-and-tear of the vehicle</li>
                   <li>Consequential loss</li>
                   <li>Depreciation</li>
                   <li>Breakdown caused due to mechanical or electrical failure</li>
                   <li>Damage/accident caused by someone riding without a licence</li>
                   <li>Damage due to war, nuclear risk, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>8. How is the Insured Declared Value determined?</strong>
                <p>The IDV or Insured Declared Value is the maximum sum assured that you can claim for. In case the vehicle is stolen or lost, the insurer will pay you the IDV. The IDV is calculated by reducing the depreciation value from the current selling price of the vehicle. If your vehicle is modified or fitted with accessories that were not installed by the manufacturer, the IDV for these accessories will be calculated separately. A few factors that will determine the Insured Declared Value of your two-wheeler are the vehicle type, vehicle make, the model, the state of registration, etc. When the insurer fixes your vehicle's IDV, ensure that this value is close to the current market value of your vehicle. You will also have to remember that if your two wheeler has a higher IDV, the premium payable is also likely to be high, and vice versa.</p>
                <strong>9. Will installing an anti-theft alarm make me eligible for a discount on the premium?</strong>
                <p>Yes, any security-related modifications that you make to your two wheeler will help you secure a lower premium. Security modification, like an anti-theft alarm, make it less likely for your two wheeler to be stolen. In turn, this will reduce the insurer's risk, which will help in reducing your premium. If you make the security modifications after you have purchased a two wheeler insurance policy, ensure that you immediately notify your insurer of this and have an endorsement made.</p>
                <strong>10. What are the various means through which I can pay my two wheeler insurance premium online?</strong>
                <p>Nowadays, most insurers allow policyholders to renew their policy and make the necessary payment online, through the company's official website. You can choose to pay your premium through Net Banking, Debit/Credit Card, NEFT, mobile wallets, etc. However, you must remember that not all insurers will have all electronic payment methods listed on the site, and you will have to choose from the options that you see on the concerned website.</p>
                <strong>11. Will filing a claim cause my premium payable to increase in the following year?</strong>
                <p>If you don't make any claims during your policy year, you will be eligible for a no-claim bonus for the following year. Your no-claim bonus will help you secure a discounted premium for the next year. If you make a claim, you will lose the no-claim bonus, and your premiums may increase the following year. Hence, it is recommended that you don't file claims for miniscule damages.</p>
                <strong>12. How many claims can I make per policy year under my two wheeler insurance policy?</strong>
                <p>There is no limit to the number of claims you can make per year, provided it falls within your sum insured. Anything over this amount will have to be borne by you. However, you should keep in mind that you lose your no-claim bonus if you make a claim.</p>
                <strong>13. Can I cancel my policy during the policy tenure?</strong>
                <p>Yes, you can cancel your policy any time. Generally, the insurer will refund a proportion of the premium, based on how many months the coverage was not utilised for. Some insurers may also charge you a nominal cancellation fee.</p>
                <strong>14. What is the policy period for bike insurance policies?</strong>
                <p>There are annual two-wheeler insurance policies and long-term two-wheeler insurance policies. Annual policies have to be renewed at the end of every policy year, whereas long-term two-wheeler insurance policies can be renewed every 2 or 3 years, as per the policy tenure opted for by. Most insurers have both kinds of policies on offer.</p>
                <strong>15. Can I claim tax deductions for a private vehicle that is insured with a comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy?</strong>
                <p>No, you can't claim a tax rebate for premiums that are paid towards insuring your private two-wheeler. However, even without the tax benefits, a two-wheeler insurance policy is something you should not do without.</p>
                <strong>16. Can I pay my two wheeler insurance premium amount in instalments?</strong>
                <p>No, insurance companies will require you to pay your policy premium in advance, before the cover has commenced. The risk cover can only start once you have successfully paid the premium for the entire policy tenure.</p>
                <strong>17. What factors could cause my two wheeler insurance claim to be rejected?</strong>
                <p>There are a number of factors that could lead to a claim being rejected, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                   <li>Expired/invalid driving licence: If you don't have a valid driving licence at the time of the accident or when making the claim, your claim will be rejected, even if the vehicle has been insured.</li>
                   <li>Pre-existing damage: If the damage occurred during some event in the past, your claim will be rejected. Your insurer will only settle claims for new damages.</li>
                   <li>Delay in intimating the insurer: Intimating the insurer of the claim will enable them to confirm facts and process your claim quickly. Excess delay in intimating the insurer will cause your claim to get rejected.</li>
                   <li>Misrepresentation or providing wrong information: While purchasing an insurance policy, you will be required to provide certain information to the insurer. If you submit the wrong information, it could result in your claim getting denied.</li>
                   <li>Unregistered vehicle: As per the Motor Vehicle Act, all vehicles have to be registered with the concerned authority, before being driven in a public place. Hence, if your vehicle doesn't have a valid registration, your claim could get denied.</li>
                   <li>Overloading of vehicle: If the accident or damage was caused because the motorbike was overloaded, one will not be able to claim a compensation from the insurer. Overloading a vehicle can cause the rider to lose balance, and compromise his/her own safety and the safety of others.</li>
                   <li>Exclusion criteria: All policies come with an exclusion criteria. For example, general wear-and-tear of the vehicle is usually excluded from the policy. Hence, if damage is caused to the vehicle due to natural wear-and-tear, one cannot file a claim.</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>18. I am planning to purchase a two-wheeler insurance policy. However, the quotes I received varied from company to company. What causes this difference?</strong>
                <p>Each insurer may have a slightly different yardstick to calculate your two-wheeler insurance premiums. Your premium payable will usually depend on the risk taken on by the insurer. A few other factors that an insurer is likely to consider include, the applicant's riding experience, the policy buyer's age and gender, the model, make, and type of the two wheeler, the applicant's credit score, the past claims history of the policy buyer, and the no-claim bonus (if any).</p>
                <p>While the aforementioned factors will play a role in determining your premium, each insurer may have a different premium calculation criteria, and the risk may be calculated slightly differently, which would cause your premium quotes to differ. you can choose an insurer and insurance plan that meets your needs.</p>
                <strong>19. What are the various documents I should carry with myself while riding my two-wheeler to avoid being penalised?</strong>
                <p>You should always carry the following documents to avoid being penalised in the event of an accident or for ready inspection:</p>
                <ul>
                   <li>Valid driving licence</li>
                   <li>Two-wheeler's registration certificate</li>
                   <li>Policy document/certificate of insurance</li>
                   <li>Emission test certificate</li>
                </ul>
                <strong>20. I hardly use my two-wheeler. Is it still necessary to purchase a two-wheeler insurance policy?</strong>
                <p>Yes, the Motor Vehicles Act has made it mandatory for every motorbike owner to purchase an insurance policy for their vehicle, regardless if how often they use it. If you use your vehicle extremely sparingly and don't want to spend too much on the insurance policy, you can purchase a third-party liability-only insurance policy. Third-party liability policies are significantly cheaper than comprehensive and long-term policies.</p>
                <strong>21. Can I renew an expired insurance policy, or will I have to purchase a new policy?</strong>
                <p>If your bike insurance policy has expired, you will first need to contact your insurer and inform them of the same. The insurer will have a surveyor evaluate your vehicle, and then issue an insurance policy if the evaluation is cleared successfully. Renewing a lapsed policy, within 90 days, will help you carry forward you no-claim bonus. If you don't claim your no-claim bonus within 90 days of your policy's lapse, your accrued benefits will be lost.</p>
                <strong>22. Is it necessary to file an FIR if I want to make a claim?</strong>
                <p>In many cases, an FIR maybe required to make a claim. If the damage is caused due to miscreants or if the vehicle was involved in an accident injuring somebody else and/or their property, an FIR becomes inevitable. Also, if the vehicle or certain parts of the two wheeler is stolen, you will again have to file an FIR. You will have to submit the FIR copy to your insurer while filing the claim.</p>
                <strong>23. I might have to relocate. Will I need to inform the insurer of a change of address?</strong>
                <p>Yes, your insurer will have to be informed of your relocation. Any changes that you need to make during the policy tenure will have to be communicated to the insurer immediately. Once you inform your insurer of the same, they will provide you with an endorsement certificate, which will serve as an addendum to your policy document.</p>
                <strong>24. Is inspection of the vehicle mandatory for all kinds of bike insurance policies?</strong>
                <p>If you are purchasing a new two wheeler insurance policy or renewing a policy that was expired, you will need to get your bike inspected. However, if you want to avoid this step, you can purchase the policy through online channels. If a bike insurance policy is purchased or renewed online, inspection of vehicle can be waived off by the insurer.</p>
                <strong>25. How do I view the claim settlement ratio of an insurer? Is it a reliable yardstick to measure the efficiency of an insurer?</strong>
                <p>You will find the claim settlement ratio of the insurer on the official website or the IRDAI (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India) website. This information can also be found on certain third-party websites. The claim settlement ratio of an insurer is a very reliable yardstick to measure the insurer's performance. You should always look for a high claim settlement ratio, since this indicates the company's readiness to settle claims in a hassle-free and timely manner. It also serves as a good indication of customer satisfaction.</p>
                <strong>26. My two-wheeler was damaged in an accident previously. Can I purchase a two-wheeler insurance policy for the same vehicle?</strong>
                <p>Most insurers will not provide a two wheeler insurance policy for vehicles that have been heavily damaged in an accident previously, simply because it would be hard to differentiate between past damages and present damages, in case the insured individual was to make a claim during the policy tenure. Hence, if you need to purchase a comprehensive insurance policy, ensure you get your vehicle completely repaired and thoroughly inspected by the surveyor.</p>
                <strong>27. What are the benefits of purchasing a two wheeler insurance policy online, as compared to purchasing a policy at the insurer's branch?</strong>
                <p>Purchasing an insurance policy online is hassle-free, convenient and time-efficient. The benefits of purchasing a policy online include:</p>
                <ul>
                   <li>Instant issuance of policy</li>
                   <li>Easy/no submission of documents</li>
                   <li>Facility to opt of policy renewal reminders</li>
                   <li>Multiple premium payment options - debit card, credit card, net banking, mobile wallets, etc.</li>
                   <li>Policy document and policy-related information are easily accessible online</li>
                   <li>Inspection of two-wheeler will be waived off</li>
                   <li>Doesn't involve any middlemen</li>
                   <li>Some insurers may provide a discount to policy buyers who purchase the insurance policy online.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While there are many benefits to purchasing a policy digitally, you must remember that not all insurers may provide all the benefits mentioned above.</p>
                <strong>28. What is included under comprehensive insurance plans?</strong>
                <p>Each insurer may have a slightly different inclusion criteria. Hence, ensure you read through your policy document with utmost detail. Generally, most comprehensive bike insurance policies cover the following:</p>
                <ul>
                   <li>
                      <strong>Third-party liability</strong>: If any injury is caused to a third-party or if their property or assets are damaged due to an accident, your policy will cover this liability
                   </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                   <li>
                      <strong>Coverage against natural calamities</strong>: Natural calamities, like earthquakes, fire, floods, hurricanes, storms, heavy rains, etc. may cause significant damage to your vehicle. Comprehensive insurance plans provide a coverage against this.
                   </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                   <li>
                      <strong>Coverage against man-made calamities</strong>: Theft, acts by miscreants, damage caused due to collision, etc. are a few man-made events that can cause damage to your two-wheeler. You can file a claim in case vehicular damage is caused due to a man-made calamity.
                   </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                   <li>
                      <strong>Coverage against personal accidents</strong>: The probability of a rider being injured in a two-wheeler accident is very high, unfortunately. If you have a valid comprehensive insurance policy at the time of the accident, you could claim a compensation for the same. In addition, you can also opt for a personal accident cover for the pillion rider, under certain comprehensive two-wheeler insurance plans.
                   </li>
                </ul>
                <strong>29. Will I have to undergo any out-of-pocket expenses if I make a cashless bike insurance claim?</strong>
                <p>Under cashless claims, the insurer will directly settle the bill with the garage. You won't have to go through the hassle of paying the bills and claiming a reimbursement. However, if you have opted for a deductible, then you will have to settle your share of the deductible. In this case, you might have to incur some out-of-pocket expenses. Also, if your policy does not cover your accessories and your accessories have been damaged in the accident, your cashless claim will not cover these expenses. You will have to get your accessories fixed or replaced and bear the expenses yourself.</p>
                <strong>30. I am planning to sell my bike and purchase a new bike. Is transferring the two wheeler insurance policy necessary or can I just purchase a new policy?</strong>
                <p>It is recommended that you transfer your existing policy, instead of purchasing a new insurance policy. Transferring your policy will help you maintain your no-claim bonus. If you just purchase a new policy, your no-claim bonus will be lost. Also, if the buyer of your two-wheeler meets with an accident and then raises a claim, you might have to go through certain hassles. Hence, always ensure you transfer your two-wheeler insurance policy.</p>
                <strong>31. Can the no-claim bonus be transferred in case I change my insurer?</strong>
                <p> Yes, your no-claim bonus can be transferred even if you change your insurer. You will need to give a written request to your insurer 45 days prior to your policy's expiry date in order to port your insurance policy. You can then request for a no-claim certificate from your existing insurer, and provide this certificate to the next insurer, and a claim a discount on your premium.</p>
                <strong>
                32. I would like to purchase a long-term bike insurance policy? Will different policy documents be issued for each year or will only one policy document be issued for the entire tenure?
                </strong>
                <p> If you purchase a long-term bike insurance policy for 2 or 3 years, you will be issued a single policy document. You won't be issued different policy documents for each year. If you need to make any change to your policy, you will need to get an endorsement made.</p>
                <strong>
                33. What are the different types of bike insurance policies available in the market?
                </strong>

                   <li>
                      Third-party liability-only policy
                   </li>

                   </li>
                </ul>
                <p> However, you can customise your coverage by opting for add/on riders. These add-on riders will enable you to enhance the level of protection accorded to you.</p>
                <strong>
                34. How is 'Total Loss' defined in terms of two wheeler insurance?
                </strong>
                <p> If your vehicle is damaged to such an extent that the cost of repair exceeds 75% of the IDV or the Insured Declared Value, then your vehicle is said to be under Total Loss. </p>
                <strong>
                35. Why should I purchase a comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy when only a third-party liability policy is mandatory?
                </strong>
                <p>Third-party liability-only policies will provide coverage against damage or injury caused to a third-party or their property/assets.

Further, you can also opt for a cover for your pillion rider, a cover for accessories, etc. You can opt for the type of coverage based on your needs, but a comprehensive insurance plan will provide you a more exhaustive coverage.</p>

                <strong>39. What is third-party bike insurance?</strong>
                <p>The <strong>third-party two wheeler insurance cover</strong> or third-party liability cover is mandatory as per the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. This two wheeler insurance cover is the most basic form of motor insurance and is affordable. Coverage for the third-party insurance policy is extended only to the third party involved in the accident, provided that the third party was the victim and the policyholder was at fault. That said, the third party insurance policy does not extend any coverage to the policyholder and he/she will have to cover the expenses for damages or medical attention from their own pocket. The third-party liability cover covers damages caused to the third-party vehicle, and extends coverage for medical expenses if the accident leads to bodily injury or disability of the third party. This type of policy also offers compensation in the case of death of the third party.</p>
                <strong>40. What is comprehensive bike insurance?</strong>
                <p>Unlike the third-party insurance policy, a comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy focuses on offering coverage for both the policyholder and the third party. A comprehensive bike insurance extends coverage to the policyholder and third party to take care of expenses following damage to the vehicle or cover for medical expenses if one has suffered from bodily injury or disability following an accident. It also offers a death benefit payout to the legal heirs of the policyholder or the third party. Apart from coverage following accidents, a comprehensive two-wheeler insurance policy also offers coverage for a damaged two-wheeler following a natural calamity such as an earthquake, flood, lighting, landslide, etc. It also offers coverage for man-made calamities such as a fire, riots, strikes, etc. Lastly, a comprehensive two-wheeler insurance policy offers compensation in case the vehicle is stolen or if it is deemed a total loss following an accident or calamity.</p>
                <strong>41. What is Voluntary Deductibles?</strong>
                <p>It is a percentage of amount chosen by you (the policyholder) to pay as a part of the claim amount. The amount you pay is completely up to your affordability, and this percentage will be decided while purchasing a policy. But this is a mentor loss borne by you every time you make a claim. The higher voluntary deductible you choose, lowers the premium amount. There is another type of deductible called compulsory deductible that is set by the IRDAI.</p>
                <strong>42. What type of bike insurance should I buy?</strong>
                <p>The standard policy that is mandatory to buy under the law is Third-party Liability. It covers a wide range of uncertainties that the owner of the bike causes to the third-party. Apart from this, if you wish to go an extra step to protect yourself and the bike from damages and other uncertainties, you can buy Comprehensive policy as it also covers third-party liability as well.</p>
                <strong>43. What is the period of cover for a bike insurance?</strong>
                <p>A standard policy gives you a cover for one year after which you have to renew it on regular basis. The second option is you can choose to buy a long-term policy which gives you a cover for three years. By choosing long-term cover, you can get discounts on premium amount and avail other extra benefits available at the insurer. </p>
                <strong>44. Can I cancel my 2 wheeler insurance?</strong>
                <p>At any point of time you can cancel your insurance provided you can afford the damages, repairs and legal problems that may arise in the future due to own damage or third-party damage. In this case, you cannot claim the insurance subject to a month prior to the expiry date of the policy. There will be a nominal fee for cancellation of the policy. But, if you are riding the vehicle on a public space without an insurance, you will be fined for it. </p>
                <strong>45.What are the IDRAI-approved third party insurance premium rates for two-wheelers</strong>

                70.What does Total Constructive Loss mean?
                </strong>
                <p>If you meet with an accident and your vehicle is damaged beyond repair, the two wheeler insurance company will consider it to be a total constructive loss (TCL). Thus, after assessing the damage, if the insurance company finds that the cost of repairing the vehicle’s damages is over 75% of the vehicle’s insured declared value (IDV), it will be classified as a TCL. Comprehensive two wheeler insurance plans cover total constructive loss and provide the policyholder a compensation up to the IDV of the vehicle in such cases.</p>
                <strong>
                71.What will happen in case my two-wheeler gets stolen or if the vehicle damages are classified as a TCL by the insurance company?
                </strong>
                <p>If your bike gets stolen or in case of a total constructive loss, you will receive a compensation from the insurance company. The maximum amount payable, in such cases, will be the IDV of your vehicle. However, you may be paid a lower amount, based on certain factors.</p>
                <strong>72.If I happen to change my city of residence, what will happen to my two wheeler insurance policy?</strong>
                <p>If you are shifting from one city to another, you will need to inform your 2 wheeler insurance provider of the same. The insurance company will then make an endorsement for the same and attach it to your original two wheeler insurance policy. To obtain the endorsement from the insurer, you will need to submit a letter to the insurance company with proof of your new address. Certain endorsements might cost you a certain sum of money. Also, if you are shifting from a Zone A city to a Zone B city, or vice versa, there will be a corresponding change in the premium rate as well. </p>
                <strong>73.How do I apply for a driving license?</strong>
                <p>You will need to pass the driving/riding test conducted by your local RTO. The driving licence will be given to you if you pass the test.</p>
                <strong>74.What is an RTO?</strong>
                <p>The RTO or Regional Transport Office, also called Regional Transport Authority (RTA), is an arm of the Government of India and is responsible for issuing driving licences, selling customised registration numbers, maintaining a database of vehicles and drivers/riders for all states of India, and so on. RTOs are present in every city/district and are primarily responsible for the enforcement of the guidelines and rules of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. </p>
                <strong>75.How does the city in which the vehicle is registered affect the premium rate of a bike insurance policy?</strong>
                <p>Motor insurance firms in India have categorised the whole of India into Zone A and Zone B for private vehicles. Zone A comprises cities like Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata, Pune, and New Delhi. All the cities and towns in India fall under Zone B. If your vehicle is registered under an RTO in Zone A, you will be charged a higher premium for a two wheeler insurance policy. In comparison, the two wheeler insurance premium rates for vehicles registered under RTOs in Zone B locations are lower.</p>
                <strong>76.What is the pillion rider cover?</strong>
                <p>Both third-party liability-only insurance policies and comprehensive two wheeler insurance policies provide a personal accident cover to the owner/rider of the vehicle, up to a certain pre-specified sum insured. However, the personal accident cover provided by the base policy does not extend to the co-passenger. Thus, you can purchase the pillion rider cover, also known as the personal accident cover for co-passengers, if you want to extend the personal accident cover to the co-passenger. You will need to pay an additional premium to purchase this add-on from your two wheeler insurance provider. </p>

                   <p>Prospective two-wheeler insurance policy buyers can choose to purchase a third-party liability-only insurance policy or a comprehensive two-wheeler insurance policy based on their needs. Let’s look at the primary differences between the two types of two-wheeler insurance policies:</p>

                   <p>When you raise a claim with your motor insurance provider, the insurer will provide you a settlement after taking into account the depreciation of the vehicle parts that sustained damage. As a result, you might have to bear certain costs despite having a two-wheeler insurance policy.To keep this from happening, you can purchase a Zero Depreciation Cover. The Zero Depreciation Cover, also known as Nil Depreciation Cover, is offered as an add-on by insurance providers to policy buyers. Policy buyers can purchase this add-on for an additional premium. With a Zero Depreciation Cover, if your two-wheeler happens to sustain damages, your insurance provider will cover the entire cost, without taking the depreciation of the vehicle parts into account. </p>

                               <p><strong>5 Common mistakes to avoid while purchasing a Two Wheeler Insurance</strong></p>
                               <p>Thinking of buying a two wheeler insurance? Then you should probably know the basics of two wheeler insurance. It is difficult for the first time buyers to entirely understand the working model of two wheeler insurance other than the fact that it insures your vehicle and you can avoid fines. The study says that most of the bike insurance owners do not claim insurance as the repair costs are beared by the owners up to a certain limit. But having a 2 wheeler insurance is a lot more than what it seems and the benefits of it are also huge. </p>
                               <p>There are basically two-types of two wheeler insurance you can purchase: Third party liability policy and comprehensive policy. A third-party liability only policy like the name suggests, protects only the damages and injuries caused to the third-party person or property. A comprehensive plan on the other hand provides complete protection to the bike and you against accidents, natural calamities, third-party liabilities, own damage, personal accident protection, man-made calamities like terrorist attacks, civil protests, riots, etc. having a comprehensive policy is like having a medical insurance as it provides accident cover as well. On comprehensive policy there are a few add-on covers which are optional for the customer if he/she wants to buy. The optional covers available are zero depreciation cover, roadside assistance cover, anti-theft cover, no-claim bonus cover, return to invoice cover, personal accident cover, pillion rider cover, engine protection cover and key-replacement cover. The premium for comprehensive policy is higher than the third-party policy because of the cover capacity. The premium for your two-wheeler depends upon the cubic capacity and other factors like registration city, city of residence, age of the vehicle, manufacturer, make and model, IDV, and so on. </p>
                               <p><strong>So now that you have a basic idea of what a two wheeler insurance is capable of providing, here are few things you should avoid, if you are a first time bike insurance purchaser:</strong></p>
                               <ul>
                                  <li>Do a thorough research about <a href="two-wheeler-insurance/buying-two-wheeler-insurance-8-things-to-remember.html">two wheeler insurance online</a> to have enough knowledge so that you will not be fooled by the insurance agent. If you are a first time buyer, chances are that you might be overwhelmed with the information and would be easily confused as to which one to buy and from whom. If you are contacting an agent, do not fall for his/her flowery words on how beneficial a certain company's insurance policy is. Any basic insurance policy provides you the same amount of insurance coverage. So researching online will allow you to compare policies, plans, discounts available, and other benefits in much simpler form. You can also purchase bike insurance online on any trusted third-party website or on the insurer's website. </li>
                                  <li>If a certain insurer is offering the two wheeler insurance policy for a much cheaper rate, do not think that it is the best option for you to save money on insurance premium. Seldom is it seen that the cheaper insurance never provides you adequate or standard insurance coverage that it should provide. The cost should not be your only concern while buying a two wheeler insurance. There are affordable 2 wheeler insurance policies that can be tailored according to your needs. So never buy insurance policy that is cheaper and provides no benefits. </li>
                                  <li>It is often seen that customers do not read the document carefully before signing. Just filling in the details and submitting necessary documents to purchase a two wheeler insurance is not right. Knowing what the insurance covers, how to claim, what is excluded, what is the term of the policy, etc. is important for the future ongoing.</li>
                                  <li>It is mandatory that you have to pay certain part of the claim amount called as 'voluntary deductibles'. Many individuals opt for smaller deductibles thinking it will cost smaller premium amount. But know that larger deductibles are beneficial with bigger dividends in the future. </li>
                                  <li>Your insurer reward you with no-claim bonus for every claim free year. No-claim bonus can be availed from 20% to 50% and will be valid up to 5 years. You can opt to utilise the percentage on your annual renewal or you can choose it to carry forward to next year. So ignoring no-claim bonus while you renew will cost you higher premium amount. </li>
                               </ul>
                               <p>&nbsp;</p>
                               <p>Avoid these 5 common mistakes that everyone tends to make. It will save you from paying higher premium.</p>

                               <p>The Insurance Regulatory Development and Authority of India (IRDAI) has directed all the insurance companies to make sure that the third-party motor insurance, that is two wheeler insurance or car insurance or commercial vehicle insurance, to be easily available and affordable to all.</p>
                               <ul>
                                  <li>Earlier, the Supreme Court Committee of Road Safety department had passed an order to the State and Union Territories to periodically conduct inspections and random checkings to know if all the vehicles running in that particular city had two wheeler insurance or other types of valid motor insurance as per the vehicle requirement.</li>
                                  <li>It had also mandated that, if not a complete protection cover, every two wheeler or vehicle owner had to have third-party liability cover, else the vehicle can be seized until the owner gets a third-party cover.</li>
                                  <li>Since the number of insured vehicles were low, the IRDAI has now directed all insurers to cooperate with the traffic police officials to issue or renew the third-party two wheeler or motor insurance cover to the vehicle owners who do not have one.</li>
                                  <li>The IRDAI is taking steps to make sure that the number of uninsured vehicle will decrease by 2020 as currently more than 50% of the vehicles are uninsured. The majority in the uninsured vehicle percentage is contributed by two wheelers.</li>
                                  <li>This order was passed by the IRDAI as several state transport officials reported that the issuance or renewal of motor insurance was a tedious process which includes inspections, long documentations, etc. Likewise, the customers also reported that the process of getting the two wheeler insurance or any other motor insurance was a cumbersome process.</li>
                                  <p>&nbsp;</p>

                               <p>The IRDAI however raises the two wheeler or motor insurance premium annually and if the policy holder chooses for long-term two wheeler insurance or any other motor insurance, then they can avoid this hike for three years. Under this order, no insurer can deny providing third-party insurance to the vehicle owners.</p>

                               <p>Even though the fuel prices are increasing every day, it does not stop people from buying two-wheelers. Undoubtedly, no other vehicle can match up to the convenience and the affordability of a two-wheeler. Traveling anywhere is easier, and if you have a premium range bike, cruiser or a sports bike, then road trips are much frequent than one expects it to be.</p>
                               <p>While traveling anywhere be it on city roads or highways, accidents, mishaps, and mechanical breakdown of the vehicle are unavoidable. It’s not that we wish for it, but these are unfortunate. If you are traveling on a city road, then the driving is risky as roads are usually jammed, have numerous potholes, and traffic violations, etc. and driving on a rainy day is no cake walk either. Hence, securing your bike with a proper two wheeler insurance is very important. A two wheeler insurance is a legal enforcement as per the law of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. </p>
                               <p>The third-party liability policy is the minimum required coverage according to the said act. The premium rates for this policy is set by the IRDAI and every year the rate is revised. However, a comprehensive policy is what one should ideally buy to protect their vehicle from damages caused by accidents, third-party, theft, total loss or damage, terrorist attacks, earthquakes, riots, protests, lightning, hailstorm, etc. The premium for this policy is higher than the third-party policy. </p>
                               <p>Now, since the market is flooded with insurance companies, it is easy to get confused when you go out to purchase a two wheeler insurance policy. The purpose of buying a two wheeler insurance policy should not be just to save yourself from penalty. Hence, you should understand the benefits and advantages of having a bike insurance policy. To help you do this, you can <a href="/two-wheeler-insurance/how-to-buy-two-wheeler-insurance-wisely.html">research for the best policy</a> online and have a knowledge about the offers and discounts offered by various insurers so you could make the right choice. However, if you opt to buy insurance policy offline, you can buy through agents, brokers, etc. so it may be possible that you would be misguided.</p>
                               <p><strong> Hence, here are few tips to shop for two wheeler insurance wisely:</strong></p>
                               <ul>
                                  <li><strong>Know the type of coverage you want:</strong></li>
                               </ul>
                               <p></p>
                               <p>If you are purchasing offline, to increase commission from the company, agents may mislead you with a two wheeler insurance cover that may not be required for your vehicle. So be specific about the type of coverage you want and mention the same to the agent. However, if you are purchasing online through the insurer’s website, the process is very easy and simple. Not only does it save your time but also on the insurer’s website, you can easily know the inclusions and exclusions from the policy along with discounts and facilities offered by the insurer. This way you are saving the commission amount that you may have to pay to either the broker or an agent. You can buy the policy depending on your need and affordability by choosing between a third-party liability cover and comprehensive cover.</p>

                               <p>Nowadays, with the help of digital technology, insurers have provided the benefit of calculating your premium through an online tool called ‘Bike Insurance Premium Calculator’. You have to input few values like manufacturer of the bike, model, Insured Declared Value, age of the vehicle, policy details, number of claims (if any), owner details, etc. On submission of the details, the tool will calculate the actual premium amount that you have to pay. Once you know the amount of premium payable, you can negotiate with the insurer if you are renewing with the same insurer or you can negotiate for discounts and a better deal if you are switching or purchasing a new two wheeler insurance policy. Therefore, before you pay the premium on the bike policy, it is important to research a little so that you do not end up paying a higher premium for a low cover policy. </p>

                               <p></p>
                               <p>If you have purchased a comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy, then the insurer must have informed you about the add-on covers that are available which can extend the policy coverage. Buying add-on cover for the bike/scooter you own is simply waste of money if you do not require it. The expenses that may arise for a bike that costs above Rs.1 lakh is higher than a scooter or a bike within 100cc segment. The repair expense for the vehicle, if it was a part of any mishap, will vary from each model. An add-on option like key replacement or engine cover, may not be required for your bike as the repair cost, if any, may not be that expensive. So even if the insurer tries to convince you that it will be beneficial for you in the future. you should buy only the add-on options that you feel is necessary and affordable.  </p>

                               <p>It is a normal tendency to just flip the pages and sign the document in a rush, especially in insurance policies, rental agreements, etc. Any type of insurance is an agreement between the insurer and the buyer where the insurer agrees to provide certain facilities and in return, the buyer agrees to pay certain amount for that facility. In an insurance contract, we often read only what it covers, and skip the part of exclusions, which is most crucial. Hence, read and understand the clauses carefully on exclusion and claim process and for what type of damages can you claim and the clauses applicable to it. This will help you avoid making a claim that is not covered under the policy. The renewal terms and conditions, policy cancellation, etc. you should be aware of everything so that there is no confusion in the future.  </p>

                               <p>There is a fierce competition amongst the insurers to increase their business. Ever since the GST, the tax on insurance has been increased to 18% from 15% which has affected the business of the insurers. In the same interest, the insurers offer discount and benefits to attract the customer to buy a two wheeler insurance policy. The insurers also have tie-ups with vehicle showrooms, which provides them direct business. Therefore, it is important to research and compare online to buy the best two wheeler insurance policy.</p>

                               <p>If you have a two-wheeler, it is absolutely necessary to purchase a two wheeler insurance policy for the vehicle and renew it within the specified due date, given that the policy can provide you with financial coverage against a number of untimely events including accidents, theft of the vehicle, etc.</p>
                               <p>But you will only be able to enjoy and utilise the benefits of your two wheeler insurance policy if it is a genuine policy that is issued by a registered insurance company. However, this is easier said than done. The number of fraud cases in the insurance industry has increased in the recent past, and the issuance of fake motor insurance policies makes up for a good number of these cases. Thus, we have listed down a few tips to help you avoid purchasing a fake two wheeler insurance policy and to help you check if your existing insurance policy is genuine. </p>
                               <ul>
                                  <li>Check the two wheeler insurance company’s reliability: Before you purchase a two wheeler insurance policy from an insurance company, make sure to check how reliable the company is. You should first check if the insurance firm is registered with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI). Further, you should also check online reviews of the two wheeler insurance company, the incurred claim ratio, etc.</li>
                                  <li>Buy your bike insurance policy through a reliable channel: A simple way to ensure that you are purchasing a genuine two wheeler insurance policy is to directly purchase it from the insurance company or to purchase it from a reliable third-party insurance company. </li>
                                  <li>Beware of usually low premiums: If you find a two wheeler insurance policy that is being offered at an unusually low premium rate, you should do thorough research about the policy and the insurance company that you are purchasing the policy from. An extremely low premium could mean that the coverage offered by the policy is also low. Therefore, the premium rate should only be one of the many factors that you consider when purchasing a policy. Make sure to not compromise on the coverage offered by the policy just to secure a low premium.</li>
                                  <li>Sign the cover note/proposal form yourself: When purchasing a bike insurance policy, you should make sure to verify the details on the proposal form and sign the form yourself to avoid any problems or discrepancies during the policy tenure. </li>
                                  <li>Pay your premium through secure channels: You, as a policy buyer, can choose to pay your premiums through online or offline channels. That being said, whenever possible, you should try to pay your premium online since it is more secure. If you want to pay the premium amount through offline channels, you should try to avoid paying in cash. In such cases, it is always best to pay the premium via cheque or DD. Also, after you pay the premium, make sure to ask for a receipt for the same. </li>
                                  <li>Contact the insurance company: One of the easiest ways to check if your policy is genuine is by contacting the insurer. All the customer care channels through which you can reach the insurer will be mentioned in your policy document or on the company’s official website. Thus, you can either call your insurance provider on the toll-free contact number or send an email. You can also choose to walk into the nearest branch of the insurance company and speak to a representative about the same. </li>
                                  <li>Scan the QR code on your policy: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has made it mandatory for all insurance companies to print a QR code on the policy document. You can scan this QR code on your policy document to verify the existence of the policy. Also, when purchasing your policy, make sure to check if the policy document has the QR code since the insurance regulator has made it mandatory for all insurance policies that are sold after December 2015 to have this code. </li>
                               </ul>
                               <p>&nbsp;</p>
                               <p>In conclusion, following the above-mentioned steps will help you purchase a genuine policy that will provide you with the required coverage throughout the policy tenure. </p>

                               <p>If you flash your memory back to October, then you would remember that various two-wheelers and car owners faced a lot of problems as they saw an increase in the cost of vehicle ownership due to a ruling passed by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI). The IRDAI had increased the personal accident coverage from Rs.1 lakh to Rs.15 lakh which saw a major increase in the cost of vehicle ownership.</p>
                               <p>However, there is some good news for the two-wheelers and car owners as IRDAI has announced the unbundling of compulsory personal accident covers and permitted the issuance of standalone policies from January 1 which means that there will be a significant drop in the cost of vehicle ownership as the new year commences.</p>
                               <p>If you were a policyholder, you would have to pay Rs.750 per annum for both car and two-wheeler insurance policy. Now you will be paying only Rs.750 if you have a standalone cover.</p>
                               <p>1 January will see bundles compulsory personal accident cover getting expired and instead of being replaced with standalone policies. This means that if you have a 24-hour personal accident cover which provides you cover against death and permanent disability for a coverage of Rs.15 lakh, then you do not require to take a separate compulsory personal accident cover. The insurance companies will now have to come up with personal compulsory personal accident cover of Rs.15 lakh which will be available to all kinds of customers. If a customer has a compulsory personal accident cover, then that person does not require to purchase another cover.</p>
                               <p>A policyholder can choose to opt for a <a href="/two-wheeler-insurance/two-wheeler-insurance-claim-after-accident.html">compulsory personal accident cover</a> as a part of a package only policy or liability only policy, in today’s scenario one can continue to do so. In case if a person decides to take a standalone compulsory personal accident policy then the compulsory personal accident cover can be offered as a part of a package only policy or a liability only package.</p>
                               <p>But why is IRDAI offering unbundled policies? There has been news from various quarters that various drivers already own an existing general personal accident cover which has been a reason for insurance companies to consider.</p>
                               <p>Also, a driver may own more than one vehicle and as such does not need more than compulsory personal accident policy. Under the standalone compulsory personal accident policy, a  driver will get coverage on all the vehicles that he/she owns. The compulsory personal accident cover will be applicable only on the vehicles are driven by the driver.</p>
                               <p>Earlier IRDAI had asked the insurance companies to provide a minimum cover of Rs.15 lakh under compulsory personal accident at a premium of Rs.750per annum for annual policies for both two-wheelers and cars. IRDAI had said that the insurance company could offer covers in multiple of Rs.1 lakh and Rs.5 lakh, but the minimum coverage should be Rs.15 lakh.</p>
                               <p>However, under a circular dated October 9, 2018, it is the choice of the driver to op for a one-year compulsory personal accident cover or for a long-term compulsory personal accident cover and the insurance company cannot force the drivers to go for a long-term package policy or long-term PAC policy. The insurance companies have been directed by the insurance companies to ensure that they offer the choice of a one-year compulsory personal accident cover to owner cum drivers only.</p>

                               <p>Recent studies have shown that at least 75% of two wheelers traveling on Indian roads are not insured. And few people who were interviewed by the organisations who conducted this study were cited saying that buying two wheeler insurance was waste of money, the two wheeler insurance does not benefit us, etc. It is because of lack of awareness about bike insurance, and the benefits of the same, the number of uninsured vehicles have increased. </p>
                               <p>The IRDAI has recently urged both the police officials and the insurance companies to co-operate with the government to help in checking for motor insurance with every two-wheeler owner. Any two-wheeler owner who does not have a bike insurance will be fined for the same. The IRDAI has also regulated that the bikes which do not have motor insurance should immediately avail the third-party insurance with any insurer. Having two wheeler insurance is mandatory under the law. It is risky to drive 2 wheeler on Indian roads, and therefore it is necessary that every bike owner insures themselves with two-wheeler insurance. There are mainly two-kinds of two wheeler insurance: Third-party liability cover and comprehensive policy. The third-party liability cover protects only the third-party person to whom damage or injury is caused by the insured vehicle. The comprehensive policy on the other hand provides complete protection to the vehicle and the owner. There are few add-on covers like zero depreciation cover, personal accident cover, <a href="/two-wheeler-insurance/invoice-protection-for-two-wheeler-insurance.html">return to invoice cover</a>, etc. which can be availed for extra premium along with comprehensive policy.</p>
                               <p>Having a two wheeler insurance is no less than having a medical insurance as it provides personal accident protection to the owner. So what are the consequences you might face if you do not own a two wheeler insurance?</p>
                               <ul>
                                  <li>You will be penalised by the police on a random checking for Rs. 1,000 or you could be imprisoned up to 3 months as per Motor Vehicle Act. Because driving without an insurance leaves you open for many dangerous situations. Your driving license will also be canceled for the same act. </li>
                                  <li>If your bike is not insured with a comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy which protects you against damages like accident, own damage, third-party liability, natural calamities, man-made calamities, etc. If you do not have this cover, the cost of repair for the damages occurred by these situations will have to be borne by you. If it is a third-party damage, the legal proceedings cost and the compensation to the third-party will also have to be borne by you. </li>
                                  <li>If you have a policy already and have forgotten to renew it, you will lose No claim bonus. NCB is a discount given to you in the form of reward for not claiming the insurance in that particular year. If your vehicle is uninsured for 90 days, you will lose the entire accumulated no claim bonus. And if you are looking to change the insurer, and not obtained your new insurer within these 90 days, you will lose the opportunity to transfer the NCB. </li>
                                  <li>If you have not renewed your policy on time, reinstating the bike insurance policy is definitely a time consuming process. On submitting an application to renew, your vehicle will be inspected by a survey inspector sent by the insurance company. The insurance company will increase the premium amount in this scenario. If the vehicle is too old or has too many repairs or damaged, the insurance company may also reject the policy. </li>
                               </ul>
                               <p>&nbsp;</p>
                               <p>The consequences and the loss from not having an insurance is much higher than purchasing a two wheeler insurance. The premium to avail a bike insurance is very nominal ad it is fixed by the IRDAI according to the cubic capacity of the vehicle. So get your insurance today to avoid penalties and legal tangles. You can buy two wheeler insurance online through any trusted third-party websites or through the insurer's website by submitting few details of the vehicle and yours with just few clicks. It is quick and easy, time saving and money saving. Let's insure our bikes and enjoy a stress free ride. </p>

                               <p>Following a recent Supreme Court order, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) issued a circular instructing all motor insurance providers to offer long-term third-party liability insurance policies. Thus, motor insurance companies were instructed to offer 5-year third-party liability insurance policies for two-wheelers and three-year third-party liability insurance policies for four-wheelers. </p>
                               <p>Insurance companies could also offer long-term package insurance policies that would offer both the third-party liability insurance cover and the own damage cover for a duration of 5/3 years, as applicable, and bundled insurance policies that would offer a 5-year/3-year third-party liability insurance cover and a 1-year own damage cover. </p>
                               <p>Following this, the Madras High Court issued an order directing the IRDAI to increase the Compulsory Personal Accident (CPA) cover from Rs.1 lakh to Rs.15 lakh.

                               <p>The insurance regulator has now issued certain clarifications regarding the implementation of the Compulsory Personal Accident Cover. The revised circular by the IRDAI states that motor insurance policy buyers could opt for a one-year Compulsory Personal Accident cover or a long-term CPA cover. </p>
                               <p>The insurance regulator further stated that motor insurance companies should not make it mandatory for policy buyers to purchase a long-term package two wheeler insurance/car insurance policy or to buy a long-term Compulsory Personal Accident cover. Motor insurance companies have, thus, been instructed to offer policy buyers the option to purchase a one-year Compulsory Personal Accident cover. </p>

That being said, you should also invest in a good bike cover for times when you might not be able to find a covered parking spot. </li>
                                  <li><strong>Reflective Stickers</strong>: If you are someone who rides at night, make sure to purchase reflective stickers for your bike to increase the visibility of your vehicle. </li>
                                  <li><strong>Crash Protectors</strong>: In the event of an accident, a crash protector will absorb the impact and, as a result, save your two-wheeler from getting scratches or dents. You can also consider purchasing a leg guard, which will prevent your legs from trapping under the two-wheeler in the event of an accident.</li>
                               </ol>
                               <p>&nbsp;</p>
                               <p>In addition to all the above-mentioned accessories, you should also make sure to purchase a two wheeler insurance policy for coverage against financial risks that might arise in case something unfortunate happens.</p>

                               <p>Following an order from the Supreme Court, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has made it mandatory for all new vehicle buyers to purchase long-term third-party liability insurance policies. In the case of two-wheelers, new vehicle buyers will have to mandatorily have a third-party liability insurance policy for a period of 5 years, while new car buyers can purchase third-party insurance policies for a three-year period. </p>
                               <p>As a result, motor insurance companies are currently offering up to three types of two wheeler insurance policies to new two-wheeler buyers. Thus, if you are a new vehicle buyer, you can choose to purchase one of the below-mentioned variants of the two wheeler insurance policy:</p>
                               <ul>
                                  <li><strong>Standalone Long-Term Third-Party Liability-Only Insurance Policy</strong>: This is the most basic variant of the two wheeler insurance policy. Starting from September 1, all <a href="/two-wheeler-insurance/tips-on-purchasing-new-two-wheeler.html">new two-wheeler buyers</a> will mandatorily have to purchase a 5-year third-party liability insurance policy. This policy provides coverage against death/bodily injuries suffered by a third party and damage caused to a third party’s assets. Further, the vehicle owner is also provided a cover against death and disability. </li>
                                  <li><strong>Bundled two wheeler insurance Policy</strong>: The bundled two wheeler insurance policy provides a 5-year third-party liability insurance cover and a 1-year own damage cover to new two-wheeler buyers. In this case, while the third-party liability insurance cover is provided for a longer tenure, the own damage component of the policy will have to be renewed on a yearly basis. The insurance regulator is expected to come up with guidelines regarding the renewal structure of the own damage component of the policy. </li>
                                  <li><strong> Long-Term Comprehensive two wheeler insurance Policy</strong>: The long-term comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy provides a 5-year cover against both third-party liability and own vehicle damage. Thus, in addition to covering third-party legal liability, this type of policy will also cover damages to one’s own vehicle due to accidents, man-made events/natural calamities, and total loss of the vehicle. The policy also provides a personal accident cover to the policy buyer. </li>
                               </ul>
                               <p><strong>Impact of the Long-Term Third-Party Liability-Only Insurance Policy</strong></p>
                               <ul>
                                  <li><strong>Renewal of Old two wheeler insurance Policies</strong>: The new rule is only applicable to new vehicle buyers. Thus, individuals who purchased two wheeler insurance policies before September 1 can continue renewing their policies as per the due date specified in their respective policy documents. </li>
                                  <li><strong>No Claim Bonus</strong>: The No Claim Bonus is applicable on the own damage component of the two wheeler insurance policy. Thus, if a vehicle owner purchases a standalone third-party liability insurance policy, a No Claim Bonus will not be offered to the concerned individual. For individuals who have purchased two wheeler insurance policies with an own damage component, the No Claim Bonus will be paid out after the completion of the tenure of the cover. </li>
                                  <li><strong>Premium Rates</strong>: Premium rates for third-party liability insurance cover for bikes with a larger engine capacity will increase. In comparison, motor vehicles with small engines will have to pay a lower premium rate. Since the third-party liability insurance cover is also part of the bundled and comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy, the premium rates of these policies will also be affected.</li>
                               </ul>
                               <p>If you are looking to purchase a new two-wheeler, it is necessary to familiarise yourself with the new guidelines. Make sure to do your research and check what policies are available to you. You should, ideally, be aware of the premium rates, features, and benefits of various policies to ensure that you are able to make an informed choice when it comes to picking a two wheeler insurance policy for your new vehicle. </p>

                               <h2>Tips to Ride Your Two-Wheeler Safely During Winter:</h2>
                               <p>Given that winter is just around the corner, you, as a two-wheeler owner should keep the below-mentioned tips in mind to ensure safety for you and your two-wheeler during this season:</p>
                               <ul>
                                  <li><strong>Layer Up</strong>: It is vital that you wear the right clothing have the necessary riding gear when riding your two-wheeler in the cold. That being said, what you will need to wear while riding during winter is largely dependent on where you live and how cold it is where you stay. Thus, make sure to wear thermals, which will keep you feeling warm, if needed. You should also wear a water-resistant, protective outer layer if it is misty. Ensure that you wear a helmet to keep yourself insulated from the cold. You should also invest in good-quality gloves and winter boots for sufficient protection. </li>
                                  <li><strong>Be Aware of Your Surroundings:</strong> When riding your two-wheeler, you should ensure that you pay attention to your surroundings. Mist and fog, which are quite common during winter, can reduce visibility significantly. This can make it difficult for other drivers/riders/pedestrians to spot you and for you to know what lies ahead. Thus, you should, ideally, keep a safe distance from other vehicles and pedestrians on the road. Further, if rain or snow during the winter is a common occurrence where you live, make sure to ride at a slow pace and watch out for snow/puddles on the road. </li>
                                  <li><strong>Get Your Vehicle Serviced:</strong> A sudden breakdown while riding your vehicle can cause you significant distress. Thus, before the start of the winter season, it is best to get your two-wheeler serviced. The garage can check your vehicle and ensure that it is working the way it should. Further, you can also get your two-wheeler’s tyres lubricated and the tyre pressure checked at the garage. </li>
                                  <li><strong>Pull Over When Necessary:</strong> At times, despite the best of your efforts, riding in the winter might not be practical. If the visibility is so low that you can’t see what’s ahead or if the cold is causing you extreme discomfort, you should immediately pull over. You can either park the vehicle at a nearby parking spot or get the vehicle towed. Post this, make sure to arrange an alternate mode of transport so you can reach your destination safely.</li>
                                  <li><strong>Insure Your Two-Wheeler:</strong> Regardless of how good of a rider you are, it is best to always be prepared. To this end, you should ensure that you have a two wheeler insurance policy. You can purchase either a third-party liability insurance policy or a two wheeler insurance policy with an own damage cover. Since third-party liability insurance policies do not offer an own damage cover, it is best to opt for a comprehensive two wheeler insurance policy. You can also choose to enhance this policy by purchasing riders/add-ons that are offered by the insurer such as the zero depreciation cover, engine protector cover, personal accident cover for the pillion rider, etc. If you already have a two wheeler insurance policy, make sure to keep the renewal date of the policy in mind so you can renew your policy on time.</li>
                               </ul>
                               <p>Ensure to keep the above-mentioned tips in mind and ride safely during the winter. </p>
