       <h3>Here’s How You Can Improve Your Credit Score With the Help of Your Credit Card</h3>
       </p>
       <strong>Make a monthly budget</strong>
       <p>It is important to keep a monthly budget when you have a credit card. When you hold a card, it often happens that you spend more than you can pay back. Hence, you should have a monthly budget and stick to it. If your expenses are more than you can repay, banks will see your spending habits as irresponsible which affects your score. Apart from this, since you might have a large sum to pay at the end of the month and cannot pay it, it affects your credit score negatively.  </p>
       <strong>Paying in full and on time</strong>
       <p>It is often understood that holding a credit card can mean not repaying the money in full or in time as many banks allow you to pay only the minimum balance. However, you might not realise it, but this also affects your credit score.  </p>
       <p>If you plan your budget adequately, you can pay your credit card bill in full and in time. The banks realise your spending and repaying behaviour and this affects your score positively. </p>
       <strong>Treat your credit card like a debit card</strong>
       <p>Using your credit card like you use your debit card is something which will help you curtail your expenses to a great extent. If you do not have money in your savings account, you cannot withdraw any money. By applying the same to your credit card, you can avoid a lot of extra expenditure which might not be a necessity.  </p>
       <strong>Keeping a low credit utilisation ratio </strong>
       <p>One of the most important factors which plays a role in your credit score is your credit utilisation ratio. You should always maintain a low credit utilisation score on any of your credit cards. If you keep spending more than you can repay, it affects this ratio by increasing it. This affects your credit score in a negative way.  </p>

                   <p>When you don’t pay the total outstanding amount on a credit card by the due date, you’re automatically opting for the revolving credit facility. This means the borrowed amount which is not repaid on time attracts interest or finance charge.  </p>
                   <p>The interest charge is also applicable when you pay only the minimum amount due or anything less than the total amount due.  </p>
                   <p>Further, cash withdrawals attract interest from the date of the transaction till the amount is repaid in full.  </p>
                   <p>The interest rate is charged at a monthly percentage rate or an annual percentage rate (APR) and varies from card to card. The issuer will communicate the rate of interest at the time of card issuance.  </p>

                   <p>When managed properly, a credit card acts as an interest-free credit line. This means you don’t have to pay any interest if the borrowed amount is repaid in the stipulated time.  </p>
                   <p>The period between a transaction date and the credit card bill payment due date is called the ‘Interest-Free Period’.  </p>
                   <p>If you pay the transaction amount on or before the due date, you don’t have to pay any interest, hence the in-between period is termed as Interest-free period or grace period.   </p>
                   <p>The grace period varies for each credit card transaction and the typical period ranges from 30 to 45 days. Transactions carried out at the beginning of your credit card billing cycle would provide you with a longer grace-period. </p>
                   <p>However, the grace period is not applicable if the previous month's due has not been paid in full.  </p>
                   <p>Also, cash withdrawals using a credit card are not eligible for grace period. Interest on such transactions would be levied from the withdrawal date itself.  </p>

                   <p>Credit card EMI is one of the useful features offered on credit cards. There are various options to use the EMI facility. </p>
                   <ol>
                      <li>Opt for EMI while transacting  </li>
                      <li>Convert to EMI after the transaction </li>
                   </ol>
                   <p>Credit cardholders with the first option can convert their purchases instantly into EMI while carrying out a transaction. However, the product/service or the retailer should have partnered with the card issuer.  </p>
                   <p>The second option allows the users to convert any of the transactions or the total outstanding on the card into easy monthly installments (EMI). </p>
                   <p>However, the request for conversion should be made within a specific period from the date of the transaction, say 20-30 days.  </p>
                   <p>While availing the facility, cardholders have the option to choose the repayment period which typically ranges from 3 to 24 months.  </p>
                   <p>Some issuers offer 0% interest while the others charge a low or normal interest rate. Furthermore, a processing fee of 1-2% of the converted amount may also be levied. </p>
                   <p>Once you opt for the facility, you need to repay the EMI amount every month. The associated principal amount and the interest charge, if applicable, will be added to the minimum amount due on the card.  </p>

             <div class="panel-collapse collapse" id="26Oct16045143" style="height: 0px;">
                <div class="panel-body twi-auto-height">
                   <p>Banks offer amazing features on their credit cards. These features vary depending on the card provider and the type of credit card that people purchase. Some of them are as follows:</p>
                   <p><strong>Reward Points Program:</strong> Most credit cards offer a reward points program, which allows cardholders to earn reward points on every transaction they make using their cards. A few exceptions to it is that fuel transactions, insurance payments, gold or gold jewellery purchases, utility bill payments, cash and EMI transactions are typically not eligible for reward points. </p>
                   <p>The accrued reward points can be redeemed for various options offered in exclusive rewards catalogues provided by the issuers. However, card members need to earn minimum reward points before going for redemption. </p>
                   <p><strong>Airport Lounge Access:</strong> Complimentary airport lounge access and membership to Priority Pass Program are one of the most common features offered on most credit cards. Though you may not find the features on a basic credit card, most next to basic credit card offers complimentary lounge access with a limited number of visits per year, free membership to airport priority pass programs and others. With such a feature on credit card, members can enjoy free lounge visits to both domestic and international airports. </p>
                   <p><strong>Fuel Surcharge Waiver:</strong> Another common aspect offered on most credit cards is the fuel surcharge waiver facility that waives off the 1% surcharge that is typically charged on all card transactions conducted at petrol stations. </p>
                   <p><strong>Insurance Coverage:</strong> While some premier cards provide a comprehensive insurance policy that provides coverage against air accident, life, lost baggage, lost card, outstanding, etc. On other cards, the cover is limited to a few aspects. </p>
                   <p><strong>Global Acceptance:</strong> Today, most credit cards that are issued in India are international cards and are accepted by various merchants all over the world.</p>
                   <p><strong>Balance Transfer:</strong> Credit cardholders can transfer the outstanding balance of their existing cards issued by one bank to the credit card account of another bank. Doing so helps them in saving money and repaying the amount at a low rate of interest. Banks offer various balance transfer options to their cardholders allowing them to repay the amount on a monthly basis within a tenure of their choice.</p>
                   <p><strong>EMI Conversion:</strong> The feature allows the credit card members to convert their credit card transaction into easy monthly instalments (EMI). They can either choose to convert the total outstanding on their card into EMI, a specific transaction, especially big-ticket purchases into EMI and can also convert merchant transactions into EMI.Generally, these plans have very attractive interest rates and different repayment tenures. The EMI conversion will be done with no other documentation and most of the times instant. </p>
                   <p><strong>Lifestyle Benefits:</strong> By partnering with various merchants, credit card issuers provide attractive discounts and offers on various lifestyle categories including dining, shopping, travel, wellness, entertainment, etc. </p>
                   <p><strong> Travel Benefits:</strong> Frequent travellers can make the best use of the travel credit cards that provide travel-related benefits to the cardholders. Some of the common benefits offered on travel credit cards include air miles accrual and redemption for air tickets, free travel insurance, discount offers on domestic and international flights, complimentary lounge visits, discounts on hotel booking, and concierge services. </p>
