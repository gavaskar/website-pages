Annual fee and joining fee are minimal for the basic credit cards and the more benefits a card offers, the annual and joining fee increases. Many cards offer a waiver of annual fee if you spend a certain sum of money in a year. All in all, the benefits of the card must be greater than the fee of the card.</p>"

Here's a handy list:</p><ul><li><strong>Your spending pattern: </strong>Do you spend more on groceries each month and less on dining? Then get a card that rewards your grocery spends. If a major portion of your income goes towards online transactions, get a card that rewards those transactions.</li><li><strong>The reward type:</strong> Credit cards offer rewards in terms of cashback (which you can use to offset your bill), rewards points (which can be used to redeem lifestyle, travel, retail, and dining vouchers), and air miles (which can be transferred to your preferred airline's frequent flyer programme and help fund the tickets for your next holiday).</li><li><strong>Fees and charges: </strong>Compare the interest rate on different cards and the fees and charges apply. Look for a card whose joining fee and the annual fee you can afford. Also, see if there are any hidden charges.</li><li><strong>Offers on the card: </strong>Some cards have great offers and discounts when you use the card to shop on a particular website or when you use it at a particular store. Some offer great dining discounts and others are better suited for travel. Make sure you go through the offers available on the card before making your decision.</li><li><strong>Welcome bonus or gift: </strong>To get you to apply for their card, banks offer welcome gifts and bonuses. This could be the latest gadget or bonus points and miles. If you are looking to earn rewards at an accelerated pace, look for a card that offers a considerably large welcome bonus.</li><li><strong>Payment options: </strong>Most cards will allow you to make payments via multiple channels. In general, if you tend to forget to make payments by the due date, you should consider having your credit card payments automatically debited from your account.</li></ul><p>If you keep these points in mind, getting the right credit card shouldn't be too much of a problem.</p>"

Based on the type of credit card you apply for, the income requirement will differ.</li><li><strong>Type of card:</strong> Premium cards tend to come with a higher credit limit when compared to entry-level cards.</li><li><strong>Debt-to-income ratio: </strong>This ratio compares the total amount of debt you currently have to your total income. The higher the ratio, the more debt you currently have, lower the credit limit, and vice versa.</li><li><strong>Limit on other cards:</strong> If you already own a credit card, the credit limit on your new card may be the same amount.</li><li><strong>Credit history: </strong>Good credit history means you are financially responsible.

Some of them are as follows:</p><p><strong>Reward Points Program:</strong> Most credit cards offer a reward points program, which allows cardholders to earn reward points on every transaction they make using their cards. A few exceptions to it is that fuel transactions, insurance payments, gold or gold jewellery purchases, utility bill payments, cash and EMI transactions are typically not eligible for reward points.</p><p>The accrued reward points can be redeemed for various options offered in exclusive rewards catalogues provided by the issuers. However, card members need to earn minimum reward points before going for redemption.</p><p><strong>Airport Lounge Access:</strong> Complimentary airport lounge access and membership to Priority Pass Program are one of the most common features offered on most credit cards. Though you may not find the features on a basic credit card, most next to basic credit card offers complimentary lounge access with a limited number of visits per year, free membership to airport priority pass programs and others. With such a feature on credit card, members can enjoy free lounge visits to both domestic and international airports.</p><p><strong>Fuel Surcharge Waiver:</strong> Another common aspect offered on most credit cards is the fuel surcharge waiver facility that waives off the 1% surcharge that is typically charged on all card transactions conducted at petrol stations.</p><p><strong>Insurance Coverage:</strong> While some premier cards provide a comprehensive insurance policy that provides coverage against air accident, life, lost baggage, lost card, outstanding, etc. On other cards, the cover is limited to a few aspects.</p><p><strong>Global Acceptance:</strong> Today, most credit cards that are issued in India are international cards and are accepted by various merchants all over the world.</p><p><strong>Balance Transfer:</strong> Credit cardholders can transfer the outstanding balance of their existing cards issued by one bank to the credit card account of another bank. Doing so helps them in saving money and repaying the amount at a low rate of interest. Banks offer various balance transfer options to their cardholders allowing them to repay the amount on a monthly basis within a tenure of their choice.</p><p><strong>EMI Conversion:</strong> The feature allows the credit card members to convert their credit card transaction into easy monthly instalments (EMI). They can either choose to convert the total outstanding on their card into EMI, a specific transaction, especially big-ticket purchases into EMI and can also convert merchant transactions into EMI.Generally, these plans have very attractive interest rates and different repayment tenures. The EMI conversion will be done with no other documentation and most of the times instant.</p><p><strong>Lifestyle Benefits:</strong> By partnering with various merchants, credit card issuers provide attractive discounts and offers on various lifestyle categories including dining, shopping, travel, wellness, entertainment, etc.</p><p><strong>Travel Benefits:</strong> Frequent travellers can make the best use of the travel credit cards that provide travel-related benefits to the cardholders. Some of the common benefits offered on travel credit cards include air miles accrual and redemption for air tickets, free travel insurance, discount offers on domestic and international flights, complimentary lounge visits, discounts on hotel booking, and concierge services.</p>"

Here are a few tips to help you use your credit card:</p><ul><li><strong>Keep track of your spending:</strong> You can do this by making note of each transaction or by using any free mobile application.</li><li><strong>Pay your bills on time:</strong> Paying your bills on time means that you don't incur any interest on the amount. The worst thing you can do with your card is to default on your payments. This doesn't just lead to you having to pay interest, but your credit score ends up taking a hit as well.</li><li><strong>Pay your bills in full:</strong> If you don't pay your bills in full, you lose out in two ways. One – you have to pay interest on the amount you don't pay and two – you lose out on any rewards those transactions earned.</li><li><strong>Redeem rewards:</strong> Redeem the rewards you earn since that is the best way to get the best out of your credit card.</li><li><strong>Check your card statement:</strong> Make it a habit to check your credit card statement each month. This way, you can immediately dispute any transaction.</li><li><strong>Consider not taking a credit card loan:</strong> Credit card loans or cash advances have a high rate of interest and no interest-free period. You are charged interest from the moment you withdraw money up until the time you repay the entire amount.</li></ul>"

In most cases, banks will not consider this score to be ideal to offer you a credit card. However, if you have a credit score between 550 and 650, it might be considered poor credit. In these situations, if banks deem you as a responsible borrower, you might be qualified for an unsecured credit card.</p>"
