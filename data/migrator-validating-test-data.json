This follows a notification by the RBI, with the benchmark taking operating costs and current financial trends into account while computing the interest.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>MCLR Benchmark Tenure (Period)</strong></td><td><strong>Benchmark Rates (MCLR)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Overnight</td><td>8.45%</td></tr><tr><td>1 month</td><td>8.75%</td></tr><tr><td>3 months</td><td>8.95%</td></tr><tr><td>6 months</td><td>9.15%</td></tr><tr><td>1 year</td><td>9.25%</td></tr><tr><td>2 year</td><td>9.35%</td></tr><tr><td>3 year</td><td>9.45%</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Personal loan interest rates (MCLR)</h3><p>Standard Chartered Bank typically provides personal loans at a starting interest of 11.99% per annum. This means that a certain percentage will be added over and above the current MCLR benchmark, with the final interest determined after taking factors like the quantum of finance, borrower's relationship with the bank, repayment tenure, etc. into consideration.</p><h3>Standard Chartered Bank Base Rate (For existing borrowers)</h3><table><tbody><tr><td>Base Rate</td><td>9.50% per annum, effective October 5, 2015</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Standard Chartered Bank personal loan interest rate (Base Rate)</h3><p>Individuals who availed a loan before MCLR benchmarks were introduced can continue with their existing benchmark or migrate to MCLR. Borrowers who choose to continue with the base rate benchmark will be charged an additional interest over and above the current base rate. The final interest depends on a number of factors, with SC Bank having the authority to modify interest on a case to case basis.</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> All interest rates mentioned above are as of June 15, 2016. These rates are subject to change without prior notice, at the sole discretion of Standard Chartered Bank.

You will also be required to do proper research before you apply for a loan. Some of the important factors that should be kept in mind for getting a low interest rate include:</p><p><strong>Credit score - </strong>Making sure that your credit score it above par will result in you availing a loan at a fairly good interest rate. The better your CIBIL score the lower the interest rate added to the loan and vice versa.</p><p><strong>Down payment -</strong> Making a down payment upward of 20% of the loan amount will result in you availing a loan at a better interest rate. The bigger the down payment, the better the interest rate.</p><p><strong>Debt-to-income ratio -</strong> Always ensure that your EMIs, credit bills and other debts do not cross 40% of your annual or monthly income. Having a good debt-to-income ratio will boost your chances of availing a loan with a good interest rate.</p><p><strong>Loan shop - </strong>Financial portals such as BankBazaar is of great help when loan shopping. On the BankBazaar website, individuals can compare loan interest rates offered by its partner banks and can narrow down on a loan with the best interest rate relative to the tenure - one that suits their budget.</p><p><strong>Your employment and experience - </strong>This is one factor banks and NBFCs take into consideration when approving or rejecting a loan application. If you've had a stable income and worked for a reputed company, it's likely that you could very well negotiate on a decent interest rate.</p><p><strong>Make sure that you negotiate - </strong>Negotiating the interest rate on your loan is absolutely necessary. Most people just go ahead with the numbers set by banks and NBFCs, but making a negotiation will help you in the long run.</p><p><strong>Tenure - </strong>Choosing your tenure directly reflects on the interest rate added to the loan amount. Choosing a shorter tenure will result in you having a much less interest rate - though the EMIs will be considerably low. The interest rate increases with the length of the payback period.</p>"

Benchmarks adopted by the bank help in computing this interest, with two benchmarks currently in use. While interest rates computed according to base rates have been used for a while, MCLR benchmarks were introduced recently, following RBI directives.</p><h3>UCO Bank Marginal Cost of Funds Based Lending Rate (MCLR) (For new borrowers)</h3><p>UCO Bank introduced MCLR based benchmarks following RBI directives, with these benchmarks offering a better picture of current financial conditions. Factors like CRR, repo rate, loan tenure, operating costs, etc. have a direct correlation with MCLR, with any change in these parameters having an impact on rates payable by a borrower. The table below highlights the rates applicable as of June 2016.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>MCLR Benchmark Tenure (Period)</strong></td><td><strong>Benchmark Rates (MCLR)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Overnight</td><td>8.10%</td></tr><tr><td>1 month</td><td>8.20%</td></tr><tr><td>3 months</td><td>8.30%</td></tr><tr><td>6 months</td><td>8.55%</td></tr><tr><td>1 year</td><td>8.65%</td></tr><tr><td>2 years</td><td>9.65%</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Personal loan interest rates (MCLR)</h3><p>As per RBI guidelines, all consumers who avail a loan after April 1, 2016 will automatically fall under the ambit of MCLR. UCO Bank can choose to add a certain spread over and above this benchmark, with the final interest generally varying from case to case. The loan amount, repayment tenure, repayment mode (salary account with/without check-off), borrower income, etc. can all play a role in computing the final interest rate.</p><h3>UCO Bank Base and Prime Lending Rates (For existing borrowers)</h3><p>The base and prime lending rates at UCO Bank are highlighted below.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Base Rate</td><td>9.70% per annum, effective October 5, 2015</td></tr><tr><td>Prime Lending Rate</td><td>14.25% per annum, effective October 5, 2015</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>UCO Bank personal loan interest rate (Base Rate)</h3><p>The date of loan approval plays a key role in determining the benchmark one falls under, with all borrowers who availed a loan before MCLR benchmarks were introduced having an option to choose their interest mode. They can either continue paying interest determined by factoring the base rate or move to MCLR. Those who refrain from migrating will pay an interest according to the loan scheme, with rates typically ranging between <strong>12% per annum and 16% per annum</strong>. This is computed by adding a spread over the base rate, with it possible for one to avail preferential rates based on their relationship with the bank.</p><p><em>Note: UCO Bank reserves the right to change the aforementioned interest rates at its own discretion. All rates mentioned above are effective as of June 2016. Individuals looking to avail a loan from the bank are advised to check rates prevailing at the time of application.</em></p><p>Find more details about <strong><a href=\"/uco-bank-personal-loan-interest-rates.html\" title=\"UCO Personal Loan Interest rates\">UCO Personal Loan Interest rates</a></strong></p>"

Make sure that your ratio of secured loans to unsecured loans is good as the bank will consider you more responsible in this case. You must also make sure that you don't make loan applications with too many banks as it can reduce your credit score. Your job status also plays a crucial role. Make sure that you don't change jobs frequently as steady jobs and regular income are instrumental in the approval of a personal loan. The bank will only consider customers who have a steady job and are certain to draw an income that will help them clear their personal loan.</p>"

You need to check out the rates, fees, and other charges, and pick the most affordable loan. This can be done online with the help of your smartphone, laptop, or computer. All you need to do is check out the brochures of loan products on lenders' websites or visit third-party financial websites to compare and contrast interest rates.</li><li><strong>Maintain a decent credit score:</strong> After you finalise on a loan and decide to approach a lender, you need to take care of one step to proceed further. You must make sure that your credit score is maintained well. This score is given by credit bureau agencies depending on your credit behaviour. The score should ideally be 750 or above. In case your credit score is low at the time of applying for a particular personal loan, your chances of getting your loan approved will be pretty low. Hence, if you have a pretty poor score, put in that little extra effort to boost it by being properly financially disciplined. You can then apply for a loan for a better result.</li><li><strong>Job status:</strong> Your lender may actually do a background check of your job details to make sure that you have a steady source of income. You can also provide a proof of your income and proof of employment to show how much you are earning. This can be done by showing your most recent payslips, bank statements, offer letter, relieving letter, etc. Moreover, if your lender has collaborated with any of your employers, you may get preferential or special rates of interest for your personal loan.</li></ul>"

When your credit score is lower than 750, you may have lower chances of getting your loan approved. Hence, if you really want that loan, you could put in a little extra effort to enhance your credit score. This can be achieved by being spending money in moderation. You could also present a security or collateral as it will reduce the risk of your lender. In case you got an increment in your salary, you can display your income proof to show that you can afford to repay the loan promptly. You may also combine your spouse's income to boost your loan eligibility.</p>"

Choosing an Airline credit card that comes up with good sign-up bonuses would reward the customer with free air miles, discounted flight tickets and many more.</p><p><strong>Accumulate more air miles: </strong>Just like how regular credit cards help you gain reward points every time you shop using a credit card, the Airline credit card offers the same benefit, but the reward points accumulated here are termed as air miles. The more you spend on your Airline credit card, the more air miles you accumulate.</p><p>Once you've gained enough miles, you can redeem them while booking your flight tickets or hotel rooms.</p><p><strong>Sign up for frequent flyer memberships: </strong>Most airlines offer frequent flyer memberships, which would help the members to earn more air miles every time they fly. You can sign up for one or more airlines' frequent flyer membership programme, as it is completely free of cost, to avail the benefits. Some memberships allow you to earn miles on one airline and redeem them on any other airline. Hence, signing up for more than one membership will help you earn more air miles every time you fly.</p><p><strong>Make use of airline promotions: </strong>Promotional offers by airlines are again a way to attract customers and to earn business in the most competitive airline space. You can take advantage of such promotional offers to make your air travel cheaper.</p><p>Some promotional programmes which offer air miles at affordable rates are the ones to grab as buying air miles at the original price is often expensive. Keep an eye on various promotional programmes offered by the airlines to make most out of it.</p><p><strong>Earn from the airline partners: </strong>Airlines partner with other retailers such as food and beverage companies, apparels, hotels and many more. Knowing your airline partners and shopping from them will also bring you reward points. However, you need to be a member of the airline's frequent flyer programme to earn the rewards from its partners.</p><p>Now that you know how to make most of your credit card, get ready to fulfil your dream of flying high within your budget. <u><strong>Read more about</strong></u></p>"

These include the joining fee, the renewal (annual) fee, etc.</p><p><strong>Eligibility criteria:</strong></p><ul><li>In addition to the other criteria, to be eligible for the premium credit cards, you need to have a relatively high annual income which is above Rs.50,000 for most such cards.</li><li>On the other hand, there are regular cards which have an income criterion of as low as Rs.12,000 per month.</li></ul><p><strong>Joining bonus:</strong></p><ul><li>Most premium cards offer attractive joining bonus offers like reward points in bulk, complimentary air tickets, air miles, etc.</li><li>The regular credit cards either don't offer any joining bonus and even if some of them do, it's not very rewarding.</li></ul><p><strong>Reward points:</strong></p><ul><li>One primary advantage of premium cards is the privilege of a highly beneficial reward points program. You can earn points by using the card on multiple lifestyle and other categories.</li></ul><p>Also, the accelerated reward points program in these cards allow you to earn RP in bulk which can be redeemed for premium products and services.</p><ul><li>Although the regular cards also offer regular reward points and (a few of them even have accelerated programs), these are not as attractive as the ones offered by the premium cards.</li></ul><p>Here, the reward points earned are low and the redemption options are also moderate.</p><p><strong>Concierge services:</strong></p><ul><li>Most premium cards offer the special services of a dedicated concierge who would take care of all your travel bookings, hotel reservations, entertainment booking arrangement, and other such handy services.</li><li>But you are unlikely to enjoy these services in a regular credit card.</li></ul><p><strong>Lounge access:</strong></p><ul><li>With premium cards, you get complimentary and paid access to international and domestic airport/railway lounges through international programs like the Priority Pass membership.</li><li>For the regular cards, even if they offer lounge access, the number of visits would be fewer than the ones offered by the primary cards. Also, it would only be for domestic lounges and not the international ones.</li></ul><p><strong>Golf programs:</strong></p><ul><li>If you want to enjoy free golf sessions and lessons at domestic and international golf courses, you need to opt for premium credit cards.</li><li>This facility is hardly offered by any of the regular credit cards.</li></ul><p><strong>Milestone bonus:</strong></p><ul><li>For premium cards, if the annual spends on the card cross a certain amount as specified by the issuer, you get a certain large number of reward points as a bonus.</li><li>Although the milestone bonus exists in regular cards too, the quantity of reward points is not that high.</li></ul>"

Higher your income, better are your chances of availing a car loan from Axis Bank.</li><li><strong>Market fluctuation: </strong>Fluctuation in market also determines the <a href=\"/car-loan-interest-rate.html\">interest rate</a> that will be charged on your loan amount. The rate of interest may be higher if the inflation is high, and similarly can be lower if the inflation rate is lower. Hence, always check how the market is performing before availing a car loan.</li><li><strong>Loan amount: </strong>The loan amount will determine the rate of interest levied. Higher the loan amount, higher will be the rate of interest.</li><li><strong>Repayment tenure: </strong>The repayment tenure plays a role in the lender determining the rate of interest charged on the loan amount. Higher the repayment tenure, higher will be the interest rate charged and vice versa.</li><li><strong>Income-to-debt ratio: </strong>The lender checks the income-to-debt ratio before deciding whether they should approve your car loan or not. The income-to-debt ratio is nothing but the ratio of your income to the debt you own. Hence, in order to avail a car loan at a lower interest rate, you must ensure that your income-to-debt ratio is low.</li><li><strong>Relationship with your bank: </strong>Your relationship with the lender will also determine the rate of interest levied on the loan amount. It is always recommended that the applicant avails a car loan from the bank where he/she holds a bank account. The bank finds it easier to provide loan to a person who has been a customer of the bank for a very long time. Hence, there is a very good chance that the applicant will get a <a href=\"/car-loan.html\">car loan</a> at a lower interest rate.</li></ul>"

This is because a higher income indicates higher repayment capacity. To be eligible for HDFC Bank car loan, your yearly income should be at least Rs.3 lakh.</li><li>Loan amount – Your eligibility for a car loan from HDFC will be higher if you apply for a lower loan amount simply because if the loan amount is lower, the bank knows that the loan will be paid off quicker. Hence, they will be more confident to lend to you.</li><li>Repayment tenure - Choosing a longer repayment tenure can lower your eligibility for a car loan as it might give an impression to the bank that your ability to pay the loan is lower. This is because longer repayment tenure results in lower EMIs and the lender may tend to think that you cannot afford to pay higher EMIs. Therefore, the bank may be reluctant to lend to you.</li><li>Credit score – This is an important factor that most banks, including HDFC Bank, consider when determining your eligibility for a car loan. A credit score of 750 and above is considered a healthy credit score by most lenders. If you have a healthy credit score, banks will be happy to offer you a car loan and hence, your eligibility will be higher.</li><li>Relationship with the bank - As stated earlier, HDFC Bank offers instant car loans to their existing customers through the ZipDrive feature. This feature allows HDFC Bank customers to can avail loans instantly, at their convenience, with negligible documentation. This indicates that your relationship with the bank is an important factor while determining your eligibility.</li></ul><a href=\"\" title=\"Apply for HDFC Car Loan\" class=\"pull-right\"><img title=\"Apply for HDFC Car Loan\" alt=\"Appy for HDFC Car Loan\" src=\"/images/india/infographic/HDFC_Bank_Thumbnail_12_28_17.png\"/></a>"

This is an indication of your higher repayment capacity which will lead to banks feeling confident to lend to you. So, if you wish to boost your eligibility for a car loan, opt for a shorter repayment tenure.</li><li>Keep your credit score in check – If you wish to increase your eligibility for HDFC Bank car loan, make sure that you maintain a credit score of over 750. You can use the Free Credit Score tool to check and maintain a healthy credit score. Checking your credit score regularly can let you take corrective measures to improve it if your score is low or give you confidence to approach the bank is it is high.</li><li>Maintain a low debt-to-income ratio – A low debt-to-income ratio means that you have a good balance between your earnings and spends. Before banks lend to you, they will check how much percentage of your earnings goes in paying your debts and a low debt-to-income ratio will be an indication of your high repayment capacity. To enhance your eligibility for a car loan, you should ensure that you maintain a low debt-to-income ratio.</li><li>Apply for a loan for a lower amount – By applying for a loan for a lower amount, you can increase your eligibility for HDFC Bank car loan. A lower loan amount means that the loan will be repaid sooner and hence, the chances of you being eligible for a loan is higher.</li></ul>"

That is right. Below we give you a list of things that you can do which will help you fetch the best interest rates on car loans.</p><ul><li><strong>Compare the benefits –</strong> Before you pick a particular lender to avail a car loan, ensure that you explore the benefits offered by various lenders on their car loans. Once you have done that, compare the benefits and pick a lender that offers the <strong><a href=\"/car-loan-interest-rate.html\">lowest interest rates</a></strong>. Many banks offer lower interest rates to its existing customers and hence, it is a good idea to check the interest rates offered on car loans by the bank where you hold an account. Some banks may also offer lower interest rates to new customers as part of a promotion and that is why, you should always shop around before picking a lender.</li><li><strong>Choose a shorter repayment tenure –</strong> Many car loan applicants make the mistake of choosing longer repayment tenures as the EMI amount is lower on them. However, opting for a longer repayment tenure may prompt lenders to increase the interest rates on the car loan because it gives an impression of the applicant having a low repayment capacity. Therefore, if you wish to negotiate with your lender for a lower interest rate, choose a shorter repayment tenure.</li><li><strong>Ensure that you have a good credit score –</strong> If you have a credit score of more than 750, your chances of securing a loan is higher. There are some lenders that will offer you a car loan even if your credit score is low but will charge a high interest rate. It is recommended that you check your credit scores regularly and for free on the BankBazaar website under the 'Free Credit Score' section. Once you know your credit score and if it is above 750, you can confidently approach and negotiate with the lenders to offer you a car loan at low interest rates.</li><li><strong>Maintain a low debt-to-income ratio –</strong> Lenders consider the debt-to-income ratio of the applicant along with the employment status. Whether the applicant is salaried or self-employed, they should have a steady income and a low debt-to-income ratio to avail a car loan at a lower interest rate. The debt-to-income ratio is a measure of the percentage of the applicant's income spent on repayment of loans.</li></ul>"

                        "body": "<ul><li><strong>Have a good credit score:</strong> It is of utmost importance that you have a good credit score. One of the main factors that determine the interest rate is your credit score. In case your credit score is low, the interest rates will be high, or your application will be rejected. Certain banks and NBFCs do not provide a car loan if your credit score is less than 650.</li></ul><p>Lenders will also know that you are financially stable if the credit score is good. Lenders offer car loans at attractive interest rates if your credit score is good. Therefore, it is vital that you maintain a good credit history before applying for a car loan.</p><ul><li><strong>Have a low debt-to-income ratio:</strong> Lenders will always access your debt-to-income ratio before providing a car loan. In case you have any pending Equated Monthly Installments (EMIs), it is advisable that you clear them as it would increase the chances of receiving the car loan. Lenders offer car loans at high interest rates if your debt-to-income ratio is high.</li><li><strong>Compare different lenders:</strong> It is important that you compare car loans from various NBFCs and banks before you opt for one. Certain lenders offer car loans at lower interest rates when compared to others. Various third-party websites such as BankBazaar.com can be used to compare car loans from various lenders. The features and benefits of the car loan can also be compared on these sites.</li><li><strong>Make a higher down payment</strong>: The loan amount provided by the lender will decrease if you make a higher down payment. Lenders also offer car loans at low interest rates in case you increase the down payment. Making a high down payment will also provide the impression that you are financially stable.</li><li><strong>Negotiate:</strong> In case you have a good relationship with your bank, the interest rate can be negotiated. The interest rate can be negotiated based on various factors such as the credit score, income status, and loan tenure.</li><li><strong>Choose a shorter tenure:</strong> The interest rates will be high in case you opt for a longer tenure. Banks usually offer low interest rates in case the repayment tenure is less than 5 years.</li></ul><p>Even though the EMIs are low for a long repayment tenure, the interest rates will be high. Therefore, you will be paying a higher amount at the time of maturity. You can calculate the EMI by using the EMI Calculator provided by BankBazaar.com. You will need to enter basic details such as the processing fee, interest rate, tenure, and loan amount to calculate the EMI. The process to use the calculator is very simple.</p>"

                        "body": "<ul><li><u><strong>Credit Clean-up:</strong></u> One of the main factors taken into consideration by lenders is your credit score. Getting a personal loan is easier with a high credit score. If your score is low, you must check your reports to see if there are any errors. Sometimes, simple errors could have an adverse effect on your scores, and if you find any of these, you must report them to CIBIL.</li><li><u><strong>Rebalancing your income and debts:</strong></u> Lenders ask for proof of income when you apply for personal loans in order to ascertain your debt-to-income ratio. Consider the sale of liquid assets like stocks or earning more through a part-time job to increase your annual income. Doing so will increase your debt-to-income ratio and increase your chances of getting a loan.</li><li><u><strong>Consider Co-signers/Guarantors:</strong></u> If you are finding it hard to get a personal loan on your own accord, you can apply for one by adding a co-signer or guarantor. The person you choose as a guarantor must have a good credit score. Their main aim is to guarantee that you will repay the loan. However, they will also be liable to repay the loan themselves if you are unable to do so. Picking an individual with a credit score over 750 will considerably increase your chances of getting a personal loan.</li><li><u><strong>Limit Your Borrowing:</strong></u> It can be risky to ask for more money than you require to meet your financial targets. Make sure that you calculate how much you need and apply only for that specific amount.</li><li><u><strong>Choose the Right Lender:</strong></u> Every lender has their own requirements when it comes to credit scores and income. When looking for personal loans, pick a lender whose eligibility criteria you meet and apply accordingly. The problem with applying with multiple lenders is that each of them will <a href=\"/credit-score.html\">check your credit score</a>, and each time your full credit report is pulled out, your credit score drops, albeit marginally.</li></ul>"

However, that is not the case. There are certain things that you should do after paying off your personal loan.</p><ul><li><strong>The No Dues Certificate or NDC: </strong>The No Dues Certificate or NDC is issued by your lender once you pay off the debt. This is one of the most important documents that you should collect immediately after paying off your loan. It is also a wise decision to retain this document for an extended period of time. This certificate validates the repayment that you have made. Without this document you cannot prove that you have paid off your debts. In case you are looking forward to taking another loan in the near future, you will need this document to prove that your previous loan has been paid off. Usually, this document is issued on spot by your lender if you are paying off the final amount through hard cash. If you are paying via check or NEFT or any other means, the lender will issue the NDC and will either send it to your registered address or will ask you to collect it from the branch office of the lender.</li><li><strong>The Statement of Account or SoA: </strong>The Statement of Account or SoA, along with the NDC will help you prove that your debts have been completely paid off and have been paid on time. This is an optional document which is often issued by certain lenders. If your lender provides this document, you should consider getting it. However, you should also look for any sorts of discrepancies in the credit score. If you find something wrong, you can use the SoA to make the necessary changes to it.</li><li><strong>Collection of unused cheques: </strong>If you have some cheque leaves which have not been used, you should collect those as well. The collection of the No Dues Certificate and the unused cheque leaves, usually, marks the end of the closure process for the loan.</li><li><strong>Check your credit score after closing the loan: </strong>This is just a recommendation. It is not compulsory to check the credit score after the closure process ends. However, it is recommended that you check the score to make sure there are no differences in the score. If there are some chances of you availing another loan within 1 to 2 years of the closure of the current loan, it is highly recommended that you check the credit scores right after the closure of the loan.</li></ul>"

                    "question": "What is a personal loan?",
                    "answer": "<p>A personal loan is a type of unsecured loan that that you can borrow from a bank or financial institution if you require funds to pay for your financial needs.</p>"
                },
                {
                    "question": "How does a personal loan work?",
                    "answer": "<p>You borrow a loan when you are in need of credit. Once you submit your loan application to a lender for a personal loan, the lender verifies and approves it. Post this, the loan amount is disbursed into your bank account. Once you receive the loan amount, you will need to repay the lender via EMIs over the course of the loan repayment tenure.</p>"

                {
                    "question": "What is an EMI?",
                    "answer": "<p>EMI or Equal Monthly Installment is the amount that a borrower pays each month towards an outstanding loan to clear off the debt within a specific time frame. EMI includes principal and interest.</p>"

                {
                    "question": "What is a credit score? Why is it important?",
                    "answer": "<p>A credit score or rating is a number that indicates how you repay debt. It is important because your score determines whether you qualify for loans, credit cards, and other credit facilities.</p>"
                },
                {
                    "question": "How does my credit score impact the calculation of my loan amount?",
                    "answer": "<p>Your credit score is an indicator of how you handle your finances. It considers your credit card bill payment history, repayment of past and current loans, and other criteria. Your credit rating tells lenders how likely you are to repay them if they grant you a loan. The better your credit score, the better the chances are of getting a higher loan amount.</p>"

                    "question": "What is the maximum amount of loan I can get?",
                    "answer": "<p>The maximum amount of loan depends on your monthly income. In India, there are lenders who offer up to Rs.40 lakh.</p>"

                {
                    "question": "What is a prepayment and how does it help in repaying my loan?",
                    "answer": "<p>If you happen to get some extra money, you can pay it towards your loan even before the EMIs are due. This is called a prepayment. Every prepayment you make goes towards reducing the outstanding principal component of your loan. And since the principal reduces, your interest cost will also reduce. Also, your tenure gets shortened this way, helping you pay off the loan ahead of time.</p>"

                {
                    "question": "How much loan can I get if I earn a monthly salary of Rs.60,000?",
                    "answer": "<p>For personal loans, most lenders fix the minimum <a href=\"/personal-loan-for-low-salary.html\">monthly income requirement between Rs.15,000 and Rs.25,000</a>. Thus, if you have a monthly income of Rs.60,000, you can be fairly certain that you won't find it difficult to borrow a loan. The exact amount that you will be offered will, however, vary based on your repayment capacity, debt-to-income ratio, the lender's terms and conditions, etc.</p>"

                    "answer": "<p>With a monthly salary of Rs.25,000, you are likely to be eligible to borrow a loan. However, the lender will also check if you have any other outstanding loans, your credit score, repayment capacity, etc. before deciding how much you can borrow. You can use a <a href=\"/personal-loan-eligibility.html\">personal loan eligibility calculator</a> tool to know how much you are eligible to borrow with a monthly salary of Rs.25,000.</p>"

                    "answer": "<p>The minimum salary requirement will vary from lender to lender. Most lenders, however, will require you to earn at least Rs.15,000. If you reside in a metropolitan city, you may have to earn between Rs.20,000 and Rs.25,000.</p>"

                    "question": "Can I get a personal loan with a credit score below 500?",
                    "answer": "<p>If your credit score is under 500, there is a good chance that your loan application may be rejected by the lender. Even if your application is approved, you may have to pay a high rate of interest for the loan.</p>"

                    "answer": "<p>It may take anywhere between a few seconds to up to 48 hours. If you are a pre-approved customer, your loan amount will be approved very quickly. Else, you may have to wait for up to 48 hours to get approval.</p>"

                    "answer": "<p>Once you borrow a loan, your credit score will improve if you pay the required EMIs as per the schedule specified by your lender. On the other hand, your credit score will drop if you miss EMI payments.</p>"

                {
                    "question": "Is borrowing a personal loan better than using a credit card?",
                    "answer": "<p>Personal loans are a good option if you need funds for a large expense or wish to consolidate multiple debts. The key benefit of a personal loan is that you can pay monthly instalments to repay your borrowed loan amount. Further, you can also choose a repayment tenure between 1 year and 5 years to suit your repayment ability. Credit cards, on the other hand, are a good choice if you want to finance smaller expenses, provided that you can repay your balance in full at the end of every month.</p>"

                    "question": "Is it smart to consolidate my debts with a personal loan?",
                    "answer": "<p>Yes, if you have multiple outstanding debts, it is best to avail a loan and consolidate your debts. Doing this will make repayments a whole lot easier and help you clear off your consolidated loan amount in affordable instalments.</p>"

                    "answer": "<p>Yes, you can use a loan to purchase a car. That said, if the sole purpose of the loan is to purchase a car, it is highly recommended that you avail a car loan since it is likely that you will be offered a lower rate of interest.</p>"

                    "answer": "<p>Most lenders will allow you to make pre-payments or pre-close your loan during the loan repayment term. You will, however, have to pay a nominal charge to the lender for doing the same. Keep in mind that most lenders will only allow you to prepay or pre-close your loan after 1 year of borrowing the loan. If you want to prepay/pre-close your loan, ensure that you inform your lender of the same.</p>"

                    "answer": "<p>Prior to the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a service charge of 15% was applicable to personal loans. Post the introduction of the GST on 1 July 2017, a service tax of 18% is applicable on personal loans. Thus, there is a 3% increase in the payable service tax.

                    "answer": "<p>You can cancel your loan application before the loan amount is disbursed into your account by submitting a written application for the same. You will also need to pay the loan cancellation fee to the lender. Once the loan amount has been disbursed into your account, most lenders will not allow you to cancel it. You can, however, pre-close the loan. If you are thinking of cancelling your loan because you pay a high interest rate on your loan, you can consider transferring your outstanding loan balance to another bank or financial institution.</p>"

                    "answer": "<p>No, not necessarily. This depends on your ability to repay the loan. In other words, how much you can afford to repay every month. If you're able to afford only a smaller amount each month, choose a longer tenure. But remember that this will result in you paying more interest over the longer duration. Also, it will keep you indebted to the lender for a longer time.</p>"

Sometimes, if you don't fulfil the loan criteria, you may be able to get a loan by offering collateral. In such cases, you have to be extra careful about repaying the loan on time. If you default on your repayment, the lender may take possession of your collateral to cover their losses. Defaulting in such circumstances could make you lose your collateral.</p>"

If one applicant is unable to repay the loan, the remaining applicants are expected to do so. So, if you're not able to pay the EMIs on time, your co-applicant is expected to pay. If your co-applicant also fails to pay the installments on time, it will result in a repayment default.</p>"

                    "answer": "<p>Yes, applying for a loan along with a co-applicant who has good credit can help you get a loan even if you have bad credit. The scores of both applicants are considered when processing a joint-loan application. This way, the good credit of your co-applicant will help balance out your poor credit. But, remember that your co-applicant will be held responsible for repaying the loan if you are unable to do so.</p>"

Here's a handy list:</p><ul><li><strong>Your spending pattern: </strong>Do you spend more on groceries each month and less on dining? Then get a card that rewards your grocery spends. If a major portion of your income goes towards online transactions, get a card that rewards those transactions.</li><li><strong>The reward type:</strong> Credit cards offer rewards in terms of cashback (which you can use to offset your bill), rewards points (which can be used to redeem lifestyle, travel, retail, and dining vouchers), and air miles (which can be transferred to your preferred airline's frequent flyer programme and help fund the tickets for your next holiday).</li><li><strong>Fees and charges: </strong>Compare the interest rate on different cards and the fees and charges apply. Look for a card whose joining fee and the annual fee you can afford. Also, see if there are any hidden charges.</li><li><strong>Offers on the card: </strong>Some cards have great offers and discounts when you use the card to shop on a particular website or when you use it at a particular store. Some offer great dining discounts and others are better suited for travel. Make sure you go through the offers available on the card before making your decision.</li><li><strong>Welcome bonus or gift: </strong>To get you to apply for their card, banks offer welcome gifts and bonuses. This could be the latest gadget or bonus points and miles. If you are looking to earn rewards at an accelerated pace, look for a card that offers a considerably large welcome bonus.</li><li><strong>Payment options: </strong>Most cards will allow you to make payments via multiple channels. In general, if you tend to forget to make payments by the due date, you should consider having your credit card payments automatically debited from your account.</li></ul><p>If you keep these points in mind, getting the right credit card shouldn't be too much of a problem.</p>"

This doesn't just lead to you having to pay interest, but your credit score ends up taking a hit as well.</li><li><strong>Pay your bills in full:</strong> If you don't pay your bills in full, you lose out in two ways. One – you have to pay interest on the amount you don't pay and two – you lose out on any rewards those transactions earned.</li><li><strong>Redeem rewards:</strong> Redeem the rewards you earn since that is the best way to get the best out of your credit card.</li><li><strong>Check your card statement:</strong> Make it a habit to check your credit card statement each month. This way, you can immediately dispute any transaction.</li><li><strong>Consider not taking a credit card loan:</strong> Credit card loans or cash advances have a high rate of interest and no interest-free period. You are charged interest from the moment you withdraw money up until the time you repay the entire amount.</li></ul>"

In most cases, banks will not consider this score to be ideal to offer you a credit card. However, if you have a credit score between 550 and 650, it might be considered poor credit. In these situations, if banks deem you as a responsible borrower, you might be qualified for an unsecured credit card.</p>"

For those that do not know, the Merchant Discount Rate is the amount the vendor/merchant has to pay the card associate (Visa, Mastercard, etc.) for every transaction. As per the new change, the MDR will now be based on the turnover of the merchant/company rather than the current slab-based structure. The MDR is applicable not only for transactions at POS terminals but also for online transactions and QR-based transactions. As already mentioned, merchants/vendors/companies will be charged based on their turnover for the year and are segregated into two categories - merchants with a turnover up to Rs.20 lakh and merchants with a turnover more than Rs.20 lakh. For merchants with a turnover (previous financial year) up to Rs.20 lakh, a limit of 0.40% or Rs.200 will be charged for transactions online or at POS terminals. For QR-Based transactions, the MDR will be capped to a maximum of 0.30% of the transaction or Rs.200. For merchants with a turnover (previous financial year) more than Rs.20 lakh, the applicable MDR for transactions made at POS terminals or online will be limited to 0.90% or Rs.1,000.

Your card is considered authentic only if you fix your signature in the space provided on your card.</li></ul><ul><li>Sometimes fraudsters may jam the Enter and Cancel button in an ATM machine to put your transaction on hold. In such cases, do not leave the ATM counter without cancelling the transaction.</li><li>Make sure that you have memorized your debit card PIN. Do not write down your debit card PIN number anywhere.</li><li>While making a transaction at an ATM counter, make sure that no one else is there with you.</li><li>As an enhanced security measure, keep changing your debit card PIN from time to time.</li><li>If you are withdrawing cash from ATM located in an open space, ensure that you hide the PIN combination while making the entry.</li><li>Dispose of your old debit cards if you are not using them anymore.</li><li>Do not dispose of balance receipt in the ATM counter itself. Hackers and fraudsters can use this information to gain access to your bank account.</li><li>Track your account transactions on a regular basis. This will help you in identifying any unusual activity in your account.</li><li>Register for email or SMS alerts. This will help you in staying up to date with your transactions.</li><li>While transacting at petrol bunks, restaurants, and similar places, ensure that your debit card is swiped in the POS machine only in your presence. Otherwise, there are chances of your information being skimmed. Skimming is the process of duplicating a debit card with the use of a skimming device.</li><li>In case you doubt a skimming device being installed in an ATM machine, refrain from making any transaction and inform the concerned authorities immediately.</li><li>Get your debit card blocked immediately, in case it is lost or stolen. You can do so by calling the bank on their hotline number.</li><li>Whenever you receive an email or a call asking for your account details or debit card information, report the incident to your bank.</li><li>Your bank will never ask for your debit card information. Never share your information with anyone over phone, call, or message, even if the person claims to be from the bank.</li><li>While shopping online with your debit card, make sure that the website of the e-tailer starts with 'http'. This is a sign that the website is secure and genuine.</li><li>Do not save your debit card details on merchant websites for ease of making payments. Because in case the website is hacked, you will be at the risk of losing your baking information to hackers and fraudsters.</li></ul>"

The cashback can be redeemed by the customer and used for future purchases. Different banks offer a wide variety of debit cards. The reward system is generally based on the type of the debit card. Banks often tie up with different retailers for a period of time. Customers are eligible to receive cashback (occasionally other rewards) on the purchase of goods and/or services from these sellers. For example, consider the Big Billion Day sale by Flipkart or The Great Indian Sale by Amazon. During these sales, banks tie up with the seller companies to offer rewards to the debit card and/or credit card users. These rewards are often given in the form of cashback or additional discounts.
