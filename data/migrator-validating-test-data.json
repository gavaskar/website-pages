                        "body": "<ul><li><u><strong>Credit Clean-up:</strong></u> One of the main factors taken into consideration by lenders is your credit score. Getting a personal loan is easier with a high credit score. If your score is low, you must check your reports to see if there are any errors. Sometimes, simple errors could have an adverse effect on your scores, and if you find any of these, you must report them to CIBIL.</li><li><u><strong>Rebalancing your income and debts:</strong></u> Lenders ask for proof of income when you apply for personal loans in order to ascertain your debt-to-income ratio. Consider the sale of liquid assets like stocks or earning more through a part-time job to increase your annual income. Doing so will increase your debt-to-income ratio and increase your chances of getting a loan.</li><li><u><strong>Consider Co-signers/Guarantors:</strong></u> If you are finding it hard to get a personal loan on your own accord, you can apply for one by adding a co-signer or guarantor. The person you choose as a guarantor must have a good credit score. Their main aim is to guarantee that you will repay the loan. However, they will also be liable to repay the loan themselves if you are unable to do so. Picking an individual with a credit score over 750 will considerably increase your chances of getting a personal loan.</li><li><u><strong>Limit Your Borrowing:</strong></u> It can be risky to ask for more money than you require to meet your financial targets. Make sure that you calculate how much you need and apply only for that specific amount.</li><li><u><strong>Choose the Right Lender:</strong></u> Every lender has their own requirements when it comes to credit scores and income. When looking for personal loans, pick a lender whose eligibility criteria you meet and apply accordingly. The problem with applying with multiple lenders is that each of them will <a href=\"/credit-score.html\">check your credit score</a>, and each time your full credit report is pulled out, your credit score drops, albeit marginally.</li></ul>"

However, that is not the case. There are certain things that you should do after paying off your personal loan.</p><ul><li><strong>The No Dues Certificate or NDC: </strong>The No Dues Certificate or NDC is issued by your lender once you pay off the debt. This is one of the most important documents that you should collect immediately after paying off your loan. It is also a wise decision to retain this document for an extended period of time. This certificate validates the repayment that you have made. Without this document you cannot prove that you have paid off your debts. In case you are looking forward to taking another loan in the near future, you will need this document to prove that your previous loan has been paid off. Usually, this document is issued on spot by your lender if you are paying off the final amount through hard cash. If you are paying via check or NEFT or any other means, the lender will issue the NDC and will either send it to your registered address or will ask you to collect it from the branch office of the lender.</li><li><strong>The Statement of Account or SoA: </strong>The Statement of Account or SoA, along with the NDC will help you prove that your debts have been completely paid off and have been paid on time. This is an optional document which is often issued by certain lenders. If your lender provides this document, you should consider getting it. However, you should also look for any sorts of discrepancies in the credit score. If you find something wrong, you can use the SoA to make the necessary changes to it.</li><li><strong>Collection of unused cheques: </strong>If you have some cheque leaves which have not been used, you should collect those as well. The collection of the No Dues Certificate and the unused cheque leaves, usually, marks the end of the closure process for the loan.</li><li><strong>Check your credit score after closing the loan: </strong>This is just a recommendation. It is not compulsory to check the credit score after the closure process ends. However, it is recommended that you check the score to make sure there are no differences in the score. If there are some chances of you availing another loan within 1 to 2 years of the closure of the current loan, it is highly recommended that you check the credit scores right after the closure of the loan.</li></ul>"

Every prepayment you make goes towards reducing the outstanding principal component of your loan. And since the principal reduces, your interest cost will also reduce.

The key benefit of a personal loan is that you can pay monthly instalments to repay your borrowed loan amount. Further, you can also choose a repayment tenure between 1 year and 5 years to suit your repayment ability.

Sometimes, if you don't fulfil the loan criteria, you may be able to get a loan by offering collateral. In such cases, you have to be extra careful about repaying the loan on time.

If one applicant is unable to repay the loan, the remaining applicants are expected to do so. So, if you're not able to pay the EMIs on time, your co-applicant is expected to pay.

                    "answer": "<p>Yes, applying for a loan along with a co-applicant who has good credit can help you get a loan even if you have bad credit. The scores of both applicants are considered when processing a joint-loan application. This way, the good credit of your co-applicant will help balance out your poor credit.

Annual fee and joining fee are minimal for the basic credit cards and the more benefits a card offers, the annual and joining fee increases. Many cards offer a waiver of annual fee if you spend a certain sum of money in a year. All in all, the benefits of the card must be greater than the fee of the card.</p>"

Here's a handy list:</p><ul><li><strong>Your spending pattern: </strong>Do you spend more on groceries each month and less on dining? Then get a card that rewards your grocery spends. If a major portion of your income goes towards online transactions, get a card that rewards those transactions.</li><li><strong>The reward type:</strong> Credit cards offer rewards in terms of cashback (which you can use to offset your bill), rewards points (which can be used to redeem lifestyle, travel, retail, and dining vouchers), and air miles (which can be transferred to your preferred airline's frequent flyer programme and help fund the tickets for your next holiday).</li><li><strong>Fees and charges: </strong>Compare the interest rate on different cards and the fees and charges apply. Look for a card whose joining fee and the annual fee you can afford. Also, see if there are any hidden charges.</li><li><strong>Offers on the card: </strong>Some cards have great offers and discounts when you use the card to shop on a particular website or when you use it at a particular store. Some offer great dining discounts and others are better suited for travel. Make sure you go through the offers available on the card before making your decision.</li><li><strong>Welcome bonus or gift: </strong>To get you to apply for their card, banks offer welcome gifts and bonuses. This could be the latest gadget or bonus points and miles. If you are looking to earn rewards at an accelerated pace, look for a card that offers a considerably large welcome bonus.</li><li><strong>Payment options: </strong>Most cards will allow you to make payments via multiple channels. In general, if you tend to forget to make payments by the due date, you should consider having your credit card payments automatically debited from your account.</li></ul><p>If you keep these points in mind, getting the right credit card shouldn't be too much of a problem.</p>"

However, card members need to earn minimum reward points before going for redemption.</p><p><strong>Airport Lounge Access:</strong> Complimentary airport lounge access and membership to Priority Pass Program are one of the most common features offered on most credit cards. Though you may not find the features on a basic credit card, most next to basic credit card offers complimentary lounge access with a limited number of visits per year, free membership to airport priority pass programs and others. With such a feature on credit card, members can enjoy free lounge visits to both domestic and international airports.</p><p><strong>Fuel Surcharge Waiver:</strong> Another common aspect offered on most credit cards is the fuel surcharge waiver facility that waives off the 1% surcharge that is typically charged on all card transactions conducted at petrol stations.</p><p><strong>Insurance Coverage:</strong> While some premier cards provide a comprehensive insurance policy that provides coverage against air accident, life, lost baggage, lost card, outstanding, etc. On other cards, the cover is limited to a few aspects.</p><p><strong>Global Acceptance:</strong> Today, most credit cards that are issued in India are international cards and are accepted by various merchants all over the world.</p><p><strong>Balance Transfer:</strong> Credit cardholders can transfer the outstanding balance of their existing cards issued by one bank to the credit card account of another bank. Doing so helps them in saving money and repaying the amount at a low rate of interest. Banks offer various balance transfer options to their cardholders allowing them to repay the amount on a monthly basis within a tenure of their choice.</p><p><strong>EMI Conversion:</strong> The feature allows the credit card members to convert their credit card transaction into easy monthly instalments (EMI). They can either choose to convert the total outstanding on their card into EMI, a specific transaction, especially big-ticket purchases into EMI and can also convert merchant transactions into EMI.Generally, these plans have very attractive interest rates and different repayment tenures. The EMI conversion will be done with no other documentation and most of the times instant.</p><p><strong>Lifestyle Benefits:</strong> By partnering with various merchants, credit card issuers provide attractive discounts and offers on various lifestyle categories including dining, shopping, travel, wellness, entertainment, etc.</p><p><strong>Travel Benefits:</strong> Frequent travellers can make the best use of the travel credit cards that provide travel-related benefits to the cardholders. Some of the common benefits offered on travel credit cards include air miles accrual and redemption for air tickets, free travel insurance, discount offers on domestic and international flights, complimentary lounge visits, discounts on hotel booking, and concierge services.</p>"

                                "body": "<p>Credit cards are a great tool to have since they promote financial flexibility. Only when used wisely, of course. Here are a few tips to help you use your credit card:</p><ul><li><strong>Keep track of your spending:</strong> You can do this by making note of each transaction or by using any free mobile application.</li><li><strong>Pay your bills on time:</strong> Paying your bills on time means that you don't incur any interest on the amount. The worst thing you can do with your card is to default on your payments. This doesn't just lead to you having to pay interest, but your credit score ends up taking a hit as well.</li><li><strong>Pay your bills in full:</strong> If you don't pay your bills in full, you lose out in two ways. One – you have to pay interest on the amount you don't pay and two – you lose out on any rewards those transactions earned.</li><li><strong>Redeem rewards:</strong> Redeem the rewards you earn since that is the best way to get the best out of your credit card.</li><li><strong>Check your card statement:</strong> Make it a habit to check your credit card statement each month. This way, you can immediately dispute any transaction.</li><li><strong>Consider not taking a credit card loan:</strong> Credit card loans or cash advances have a high rate of interest and no interest-free period. You are charged interest from the moment you withdraw money up until the time you repay the entire amount.</li></ul>"

                    "answer": "<p>It depends on various factors - the number of days late, the number of instances and the amount due. Based on all this your credit card issuer would take a call about whether or not to report the same to the credit agencies. But once reported, it would certainly affect your credit score.</p>"

                    "question": "Difference between a credit card and a debit card?",
                    "answer": "<p>While a debit card acts as an instrument to withdraw money from your savings account or to make card-based transactions using the amount in your account, a credit card is a credit instrument that allows you to spend using the card and repay it later.</p>"

                    "question": "Can I use my credit card in other countries?",
                    "answer": "<p>It depends on your card type. If your credit card is accepted globally, you can use it in other countries as mentioned by your creditor. However, a certain fee known as the foreign transaction fee will be charged for all the purchases made abroad.</p>"
