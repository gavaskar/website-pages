This follows a notification by the RBI, with the benchmark taking operating costs and current financial trends into account while computing the interest.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>MCLR Benchmark Tenure (Period)</strong></td><td><strong>Benchmark Rates (MCLR)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Overnight</td><td>8.45%</td></tr><tr><td>1 month</td><td>8.75%</td></tr><tr><td>3 months</td><td>8.95%</td></tr><tr><td>6 months</td><td>9.15%</td></tr><tr><td>1 year</td><td>9.25%</td></tr><tr><td>2 year</td><td>9.35%</td></tr><tr><td>3 year</td><td>9.45%</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Personal loan interest rates (MCLR)</h3><p>Standard Chartered Bank typically provides personal loans at a starting interest of 11.99% per annum. This means that a certain percentage will be added over and above the current MCLR benchmark, with the final interest determined after taking factors like the quantum of finance, borrower's relationship with the bank, repayment tenure, etc. into consideration.</p><h3>Standard Chartered Bank Base Rate (For existing borrowers)</h3><table><tbody><tr><td>Base Rate</td><td>9.50% per annum, effective October 5, 2015</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Standard Chartered Bank personal loan interest rate (Base Rate)</h3><p>Individuals who availed a loan before MCLR benchmarks were introduced can continue with their existing benchmark or migrate to MCLR. Borrowers who choose to continue with the base rate benchmark will be charged an additional interest over and above the current base rate. The final interest depends on a number of factors, with SC Bank having the authority to modify interest on a case to case basis.</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> All interest rates mentioned above are as of June 15, 2016. These rates are subject to change without prior notice, at the sole discretion of Standard Chartered Bank.

You will also be required to do proper research before you apply for a loan. Some of the important factors that should be kept in mind for getting a low interest rate include:</p><p><strong>Credit score - </strong>Making sure that your credit score it above par will result in you availing a loan at a fairly good interest rate. The better your CIBIL score the lower the interest rate added to the loan and vice versa.</p><p><strong>Down payment -</strong> Making a down payment upward of 20% of the loan amount will result in you availing a loan at a better interest rate. The bigger the down payment, the better the interest rate.</p><p><strong>Debt-to-income ratio -</strong> Always ensure that your EMIs, credit bills and other debts do not cross 40% of your annual or monthly income. Having a good debt-to-income ratio will boost your chances of availing a loan with a good interest rate.</p><p><strong>Loan shop - </strong>Financial portals such as BankBazaar is of great help when loan shopping. On the BankBazaar website, individuals can compare loan interest rates offered by its partner banks and can narrow down on a loan with the best interest rate relative to the tenure - one that suits their budget.</p><p><strong>Your employment and experience - </strong>This is one factor banks and NBFCs take into consideration when approving or rejecting a loan application. If you've had a stable income and worked for a reputed company, it's likely that you could very well negotiate on a decent interest rate.</p><p><strong>Make sure that you negotiate - </strong>Negotiating the interest rate on your loan is absolutely necessary. Most people just go ahead with the numbers set by banks and NBFCs, but making a negotiation will help you in the long run.</p><p><strong>Tenure - </strong>Choosing your tenure directly reflects on the interest rate added to the loan amount. Choosing a shorter tenure will result in you having a much less interest rate - though the EMIs will be considerably low. The interest rate increases with the length of the payback period.</p>"

                                "body": "<p>UCO Bank offers a host of personal loan schemes to eligible borrowers, with the interest varying according to the scheme. Benchmarks adopted by the bank help in computing this interest, with two benchmarks currently in use. While interest rates computed according to base rates have been used for a while, MCLR benchmarks were introduced recently, following RBI directives.</p><h3>UCO Bank Marginal Cost of Funds Based Lending Rate (MCLR) (For new borrowers)</h3><p>UCO Bank introduced MCLR based benchmarks following RBI directives, with these benchmarks offering a better picture of current financial conditions. Factors like CRR, repo rate, loan tenure, operating costs, etc. have a direct correlation with MCLR, with any change in these parameters having an impact on rates payable by a borrower. The table below highlights the rates applicable as of June 2016.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>MCLR Benchmark Tenure (Period)</strong></td><td><strong>Benchmark Rates (MCLR)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Overnight</td><td>8.10%</td></tr><tr><td>1 month</td><td>8.20%</td></tr><tr><td>3 months</td><td>8.30%</td></tr><tr><td>6 months</td><td>8.55%</td></tr><tr><td>1 year</td><td>8.65%</td></tr><tr><td>2 years</td><td>9.65%</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Personal loan interest rates (MCLR)</h3><p>As per RBI guidelines, all consumers who avail a loan after April 1, 2016 will automatically fall under the ambit of MCLR. UCO Bank can choose to add a certain spread over and above this benchmark, with the final interest generally varying from case to case. The loan amount, repayment tenure, repayment mode (salary account with/without check-off), borrower income, etc. can all play a role in computing the final interest rate.</p><h3>UCO Bank Base and Prime Lending Rates (For existing borrowers)</h3><p>The base and prime lending rates at UCO Bank are highlighted below.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Base Rate</td><td>9.70% per annum, effective October 5, 2015</td></tr><tr><td>Prime Lending Rate</td><td>14.25% per annum, effective October 5, 2015</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>UCO Bank personal loan interest rate (Base Rate)</h3><p>The date of loan approval plays a key role in determining the benchmark one falls under, with all borrowers who availed a loan before MCLR benchmarks were introduced having an option to choose their interest mode. They can either continue paying interest determined by factoring the base rate or move to MCLR. Those who refrain from migrating will pay an interest according to the loan scheme, with rates typically ranging between <strong>12% per annum and 16% per annum</strong>. This is computed by adding a spread over the base rate, with it possible for one to avail preferential rates based on their relationship with the bank.</p><p><em>Note: UCO Bank reserves the right to change the aforementioned interest rates at its own discretion. All rates mentioned above are effective as of June 2016. Individuals looking to avail a loan from the bank are advised to check rates prevailing at the time of application.</em></p><p>Find more details about <strong><a href=\"/uco-bank-personal-loan-interest-rates.html\" title=\"UCO Personal Loan Interest rates\">UCO Personal Loan Interest rates</a></strong></p>"

Make sure that your ratio of secured loans to unsecured loans is good as the bank will consider you more responsible in this case. You must also make sure that you don't make loan applications with too many banks as it can reduce your credit score. Your job status also plays a crucial role. Make sure that you don't change jobs frequently as steady jobs and regular income are instrumental in the approval of a personal loan. The bank will only consider customers who have a steady job and are certain to draw an income that will help them clear their personal loan.</p>"

We are not saying using them would cut your flight expenses by half, but using them wisely would definitely reduce your expenses making your air travel economical.</p><p>Let us look at various ways to use your credit card to cut down your air travel expenses.</p><p><strong>Choose right credit card: </strong>There are a variety of credit cards available in the market that would serve your specific needs. One such card is the Airline credit card which comes with a lot of benefits for those who fly often.</p><p>Credit card issuers compete hard to attract customers and to earn business by offering various sign-up bonuses. Choosing an Airline credit card that comes up with good sign-up bonuses would reward the customer with free air miles, discounted flight tickets and many more.</p><p><strong>Accumulate more air miles: </strong>Just like how regular credit cards help you gain reward points every time you shop using a credit card, the Airline credit card offers the same benefit, but the reward points accumulated here are termed as air miles. The more you spend on your Airline credit card, the more air miles you accumulate.</p><p>Once you've gained enough miles, you can redeem them while booking your flight tickets or hotel rooms.</p><p><strong>Sign up for frequent flyer memberships: </strong>Most airlines offer frequent flyer memberships, which would help the members to earn more air miles every time they fly. You can sign up for one or more airlines' frequent flyer membership programme, as it is completely free of cost, to avail the benefits. Some memberships allow you to earn miles on one airline and redeem them on any other airline. Hence, signing up for more than one membership will help you earn more air miles every time you fly.</p><p><strong>Make use of airline promotions: </strong>Promotional offers by airlines are again a way to attract customers and to earn business in the most competitive airline space. You can take advantage of such promotional offers to make your air travel cheaper.</p><p>Some promotional programmes which offer air miles at affordable rates are the ones to grab as buying air miles at the original price is often expensive. Keep an eye on various promotional programmes offered by the airlines to make most out of it.</p><p><strong>Earn from the airline partners: </strong>Airlines partner with other retailers such as food and beverage companies, apparels, hotels and many more. Knowing your airline partners and shopping from them will also bring you reward points. However, you need to be a member of the airline's frequent flyer programme to earn the rewards from its partners.</p><p>Now that you know how to make most of your credit card, get ready to fulfil your dream of flying high within your budget. <u><strong>Read more about</strong></u></p>"

These include the joining fee, the renewal (annual) fee, etc.</p><p><strong>Eligibility criteria:</strong></p><ul><li>In addition to the other criteria, to be eligible for the premium credit cards, you need to have a relatively high annual income which is above Rs.50,000 for most such cards.</li><li>On the other hand, there are regular cards which have an income criterion of as low as Rs.12,000 per month.</li></ul><p><strong>Joining bonus:</strong></p><ul><li>Most premium cards offer attractive joining bonus offers like reward points in bulk, complimentary air tickets, air miles, etc.</li><li>The regular credit cards either don't offer any joining bonus and even if some of them do, it's not very rewarding.</li></ul><p><strong>Reward points:</strong></p><ul><li>One primary advantage of premium cards is the privilege of a highly beneficial reward points program.

Higher your income, better are your chances of availing a car loan from Axis Bank.</li><li><strong>Market fluctuation: </strong>Fluctuation in market also determines the <a href=\"/car-loan-interest-rate.html\">interest rate</a> that will be charged on your loan amount. The rate of interest may be higher if the inflation is high, and similarly can be lower if the inflation rate is lower. Hence, always check how the market is performing before availing a car loan.</li><li><strong>Loan amount: </strong>The loan amount will determine the rate of interest levied. Higher the loan amount, higher will be the rate of interest.</li><li><strong>Repayment tenure: </strong>The repayment tenure plays a role in the lender determining the rate of interest charged on the loan amount. Higher the repayment tenure, higher will be the interest rate charged and vice versa.</li><li><strong>Income-to-debt ratio: </strong>The lender checks the income-to-debt ratio before deciding whether they should approve your car loan or not. The income-to-debt ratio is nothing but the ratio of your income to the debt you own. Hence, in order to avail a car loan at a lower interest rate, you must ensure that your income-to-debt ratio is low.</li><li><strong>Relationship with your bank: </strong>Your relationship with the lender will also determine the rate of interest levied on the loan amount. It is always recommended that the applicant avails a car loan from the bank where he/she holds a bank account. The bank finds it easier to provide loan to a person who has been a customer of the bank for a very long time. Hence, there is a very good chance that the applicant will get a <a href=\"/car-loan.html\">car loan</a> at a lower interest rate.</li></ul>"

This is because a higher income indicates higher repayment capacity. To be eligible for HDFC Bank car loan, your yearly income should be at least Rs.3 lakh.</li><li>Loan amount – Your eligibility for a car loan from HDFC will be higher if you apply for a lower loan amount simply because if the loan amount is lower, the bank knows that the loan will be paid off quicker. Hence, they will be more confident to lend to you.</li><li>Repayment tenure - Choosing a longer repayment tenure can lower your eligibility for a car loan as it might give an impression to the bank that your ability to pay the loan is lower. This is because longer repayment tenure results in lower EMIs and the lender may tend to think that you cannot afford to pay higher EMIs. Therefore, the bank may be reluctant to lend to you.</li><li>Credit score – This is an important factor that most banks, including HDFC Bank, consider when determining your eligibility for a car loan. A credit score of 750 and above is considered a healthy credit score by most lenders. If you have a healthy credit score, banks will be happy to offer you a car loan and hence, your eligibility will be higher.</li><li>Relationship with the bank - As stated earlier, HDFC Bank offers instant car loans to their existing customers through the ZipDrive feature. This feature allows HDFC Bank customers to can avail loans instantly, at their convenience, with negligible documentation. This indicates that your relationship with the bank is an important factor while determining your eligibility.</li></ul><a href=\"\" title=\"Apply for HDFC Car Loan\" class=\"pull-right\"><img title=\"Apply for HDFC Car Loan\" alt=\"Appy for HDFC Car Loan\" src=\"/images/india/infographic/HDFC_Bank_Thumbnail_12_28_17.png\"/></a>"

This is an indication of your higher repayment capacity which will lead to banks feeling confident to lend to you. So, if you wish to boost your eligibility for a car loan, opt for a shorter repayment tenure.</li><li>Keep your credit score in check – If you wish to increase your eligibility for HDFC Bank car loan, make sure that you maintain a credit score of over 750. You can use the Free Credit Score tool to check and maintain a healthy credit score. Checking your credit score regularly can let you take corrective measures to improve it if your score is low or give you confidence to approach the bank is it is high.</li><li>Maintain a low debt-to-income ratio – A low debt-to-income ratio means that you have a good balance between your earnings and spends. Before banks lend to you, they will check how much percentage of your earnings goes in paying your debts and a low debt-to-income ratio will be an indication of your high repayment capacity. To enhance your eligibility for a car loan, you should ensure that you maintain a low debt-to-income ratio.</li><li>Apply for a loan for a lower amount – By applying for a loan for a lower amount, you can increase your eligibility for HDFC Bank car loan. A lower loan amount means that the loan will be repaid sooner and hence, the chances of you being eligible for a loan is higher.</li></ul>"

That is right. Below we give you a list of things that you can do which will help you fetch the best interest rates on car loans.</p><ul><li><strong>Compare the benefits –</strong> Before you pick a particular lender to avail a car loan, ensure that you explore the benefits offered by various lenders on their car loans. Once you have done that, compare the benefits and pick a lender that offers the <strong><a href=\"/car-loan-interest-rate.html\">lowest interest rates</a></strong>. Many banks offer lower interest rates to its existing customers and hence, it is a good idea to check the interest rates offered on car loans by the bank where you hold an account. Some banks may also offer lower interest rates to new customers as part of a promotion and that is why, you should always shop around before picking a lender.</li><li><strong>Choose a shorter repayment tenure –</strong> Many car loan applicants make the mistake of choosing longer repayment tenures as the EMI amount is lower on them. However, opting for a longer repayment tenure may prompt lenders to increase the interest rates on the car loan because it gives an impression of the applicant having a low repayment capacity. Therefore, if you wish to negotiate with your lender for a lower interest rate, choose a shorter repayment tenure.</li><li><strong>Ensure that you have a good credit score –</strong> If you have a credit score of more than 750, your chances of securing a loan is higher. There are some lenders that will offer you a car loan even if your credit score is low but will charge a high interest rate. It is recommended that you check your credit scores regularly and for free on the BankBazaar website under the 'Free Credit Score' section. Once you know your credit score and if it is above 750, you can confidently approach and negotiate with the lenders to offer you a car loan at low interest rates.</li><li><strong>Maintain a low debt-to-income ratio –</strong> Lenders consider the debt-to-income ratio of the applicant along with the employment status. Whether the applicant is salaried or self-employed, they should have a steady income and a low debt-to-income ratio to avail a car loan at a lower interest rate. The debt-to-income ratio is a measure of the percentage of the applicant's income spent on repayment of loans.</li></ul>"

                        "body": "<p>Purchasing a car is a big investment. Therefore, it is advisable to make an informed decision about your auto financing options. Here are some important factors that you should take into account when taking a car loan to purchase a car of your choice:</p><ul><li>Rate of interest on car loan: The interest rate on a car loan depends on the loan amount, loan tenure, and the eligibility of the applicant. Yes Bank offers car loans at attractive interest rates depending on your eligibility and the loan amount and loan tenure that you choose.</li><li>Documentation for car loan application: To process car loan application, banks require identity, age, income, and address proofs from the applicant. Applying for a car loan is a simple process but the documentation process could be a hassle for customers. Which is why, lenders compete with each other to attract and retain customers by offering speedy documentation. Some banks offer minimal documentation for existing customers as they already have the KYC details of the applicant. Other than easy documentation, two other things to look out for in a car loan lender are fast processing and instant approval.</li><li>Car loan eligibility: Before applying for a car loan, check whether you meet the eligibility criteria set by the bank. Car loan eligibility criteria vary from lender to lender. Some banks have a free online car loan eligibility calculator on their website to help applicants calculate their car loan eligibility. Any salaried or self-employed applicant aged between 21 and 58 years with a good credit score, a stable occupation, and a steady income is eligible for a Yes Bank car loan. Credit score of an individual represents his or her creditworthiness while the income of a person represents his or her loan repayment capacity.</li><li>Car loan fees and charges: Banks levy service fees and charges on car loans such as processing fee, foreclosure fee, prepayment fee, stamp duty charges, late payment fee, etc. Processing fee is a small percentage of the principal amount that is deducted from the loan amount at the time of loan disbursal. Prepayment charge is a small percentage of the prepayment amount wherein the percentage varies depending on the time period during the loan tenure at which the loan is partly or wholly prepaid. Late payment charges are imposed on borrowers who fail to make EMI payments on the due date. The penalty fee for a late payment is a small percentage of the outstanding due of the loan amount. Foreclosure charge is a small percentage of the outstanding loan amount that a borrower decides to fully prepay before the end of the loan tenure.</li><li>Down payment: At Yes Bank, you can avail up to 90% of the car value. Therefore, for the remaining amount of the car price, you will have to make a down payment out of your pocket. Applicants without a good credit score or who don't meet the car loan eligibility criteria can obtain an auto loan by making a higher down payment on a car of their choice. Making a high down payment can reduce the cost of your car loan on the whole.</li><li><strong><a href=\"/car-loan-emi-calculator.html\">Car Loan EMI: </a></strong>Finding out how much your car loan will cost you on a monthly basis can help you choose an affordable loan amount and a suitable loan tenure. It is advisable to maintain a low debt-to-income ratio wherein the EMI does not exceed more than 50% of the borrower's income. A high debt-to-income ratio can lead to defaulting on your car loan. Use the free online car loan EMI calculator available on the bank website or a reliable third-party website to get instant and accurate results. Car loan parameters such as loan amount, loan tenure, and interest rate are required to calculate car loan EMI.</li></ul><p>Yes Bank Car Loan Service Charges and Fees</p><table><thead><tr><th>Charges</th><th>Amount</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Part prepayment Charges</td><td>Part prepayment is allowed only after 12 EMI payments.

                        "body": "<ul><li><u><strong>Credit Clean-up:</strong></u> One of the main factors taken into consideration by lenders is your credit score. Getting a personal loan is easier with a high credit score. If your score is low, you must check your reports to see if there are any errors. Sometimes, simple errors could have an adverse effect on your scores, and if you find any of these, you must report them to CIBIL.</li><li><u><strong>Rebalancing your income and debts:</strong></u> Lenders ask for proof of income when you apply for personal loans in order to ascertain your debt-to-income ratio. Consider the sale of liquid assets like stocks or earning more through a part-time job to increase your annual income. Doing so will increase your debt-to-income ratio and increase your chances of getting a loan.</li><li><u><strong>Consider Co-signers/Guarantors:</strong></u> If you are finding it hard to get a personal loan on your own accord, you can apply for one by adding a co-signer or guarantor. The person you choose as a guarantor must have a good credit score. Their main aim is to guarantee that you will repay the loan. However, they will also be liable to repay the loan themselves if you are unable to do so. Picking an individual with a credit score over 750 will considerably increase your chances of getting a personal loan.</li><li><u><strong>Limit Your Borrowing:</strong></u> It can be risky to ask for more money than you require to meet your financial targets. Make sure that you calculate how much you need and apply only for that specific amount.</li><li><u><strong>Choose the Right Lender:</strong></u> Every lender has their own requirements when it comes to credit scores and income. When looking for personal loans, pick a lender whose eligibility criteria you meet and apply accordingly. The problem with applying with multiple lenders is that each of them will <a href=\"/credit-score.html\">check your credit score</a>, and each time your full credit report is pulled out, your credit score drops, albeit marginally.</li></ul>"

However, that is not the case. There are certain things that you should do after paying off your personal loan.</p><ul><li><strong>The No Dues Certificate or NDC: </strong>The No Dues Certificate or NDC is issued by your lender once you pay off the debt. This is one of the most important documents that you should collect immediately after paying off your loan. It is also a wise decision to retain this document for an extended period of time. This certificate validates the repayment that you have made. Without this document you cannot prove that you have paid off your debts. In case you are looking forward to taking another loan in the near future, you will need this document to prove that your previous loan has been paid off. Usually, this document is issued on spot by your lender if you are paying off the final amount through hard cash. If you are paying via check or NEFT or any other means, the lender will issue the NDC and will either send it to your registered address or will ask you to collect it from the branch office of the lender.</li><li><strong>The Statement of Account or SoA: </strong>The Statement of Account or SoA, along with the NDC will help you prove that your debts have been completely paid off and have been paid on time. This is an optional document which is often issued by certain lenders. If your lender provides this document, you should consider getting it. However, you should also look for any sorts of discrepancies in the credit score. If you find something wrong, you can use the SoA to make the necessary changes to it.</li><li><strong>Collection of unused cheques: </strong>If you have some cheque leaves which have not been used, you should collect those as well. The collection of the No Dues Certificate and the unused cheque leaves, usually, marks the end of the closure process for the loan.</li><li><strong>Check your credit score after closing the loan: </strong>This is just a recommendation. It is not compulsory to check the credit score after the closure process ends. However, it is recommended that you check the score to make sure there are no differences in the score. If there are some chances of you availing another loan within 1 to 2 years of the closure of the current loan, it is highly recommended that you check the credit scores right after the closure of the loan.</li></ul>"

Annual fee and joining fee are minimal for the basic credit cards and the more benefits a card offers, the annual and joining fee increases. Many cards offer a waiver of annual fee if you spend a certain sum of money in a year. All in all, the benefits of the card must be greater than the fee of the card.</p>"

Here's a handy list:</p><ul><li><strong>Your spending pattern: </strong>Do you spend more on groceries each month and less on dining? Then get a card that rewards your grocery spends. If a major portion of your income goes towards online transactions, get a card that rewards those transactions.</li><li><strong>The reward type:</strong> Credit cards offer rewards in terms of cashback (which you can use to offset your bill), rewards points (which can be used to redeem lifestyle, travel, retail, and dining vouchers), and air miles (which can be transferred to your preferred airline's frequent flyer programme and help fund the tickets for your next holiday).</li><li><strong>Fees and charges: </strong>Compare the interest rate on different cards and the fees and charges apply. Look for a card whose joining fee and the annual fee you can afford. Also, see if there are any hidden charges.</li><li><strong>Offers on the card: </strong>Some cards have great offers and discounts when you use the card to shop on a particular website or when you use it at a particular store. Some offer great dining discounts and others are better suited for travel. Make sure you go through the offers available on the card before making your decision.</li><li><strong>Welcome bonus or gift: </strong>To get you to apply for their card, banks offer welcome gifts and bonuses. This could be the latest gadget or bonus points and miles. If you are looking to earn rewards at an accelerated pace, look for a card that offers a considerably large welcome bonus.</li><li><strong>Payment options: </strong>Most cards will allow you to make payments via multiple channels. In general, if you tend to forget to make payments by the due date, you should consider having your credit card payments automatically debited from your account.</li></ul><p>If you keep these points in mind, getting the right credit card shouldn't be too much of a problem.</p>"

Some of them are as follows:</p><p><strong>Reward Points Program:</strong> Most credit cards offer a reward points program, which allows cardholders to earn reward points on every transaction they make using their cards. A few exceptions to it is that fuel transactions, insurance payments, gold or gold jewellery purchases, utility bill payments, cash and EMI transactions are typically not eligible for reward points.</p><p>The accrued reward points can be redeemed for various options offered in exclusive rewards catalogues provided by the issuers. However, card members need to earn minimum reward points before going for redemption.</p><p><strong>Airport Lounge Access:</strong> Complimentary airport lounge access and membership to Priority Pass Program are one of the most common features offered on most credit cards. Though you may not find the features on a basic credit card, most next to basic credit card offers complimentary lounge access with a limited number of visits per year, free membership to airport priority pass programs and others. With such a feature on credit card, members can enjoy free lounge visits to both domestic and international airports.</p><p><strong>Fuel Surcharge Waiver:</strong> Another common aspect offered on most credit cards is the fuel surcharge waiver facility that waives off the 1% surcharge that is typically charged on all card transactions conducted at petrol stations.</p><p><strong>Insurance Coverage:</strong> While some premier cards provide a comprehensive insurance policy that provides coverage against air accident, life, lost baggage, lost card, outstanding, etc. On other cards, the cover is limited to a few aspects.</p><p><strong>Global Acceptance:</strong> Today, most credit cards that are issued in India are international cards and are accepted by various merchants all over the world.</p><p><strong>Balance Transfer:</strong> Credit cardholders can transfer the outstanding balance of their existing cards issued by one bank to the credit card account of another bank. Doing so helps them in saving money and repaying the amount at a low rate of interest. Banks offer various balance transfer options to their cardholders allowing them to repay the amount on a monthly basis within a tenure of their choice.</p><p><strong>EMI Conversion:</strong> The feature allows the credit card members to convert their credit card transaction into easy monthly instalments (EMI). They can either choose to convert the total outstanding on their card into EMI, a specific transaction, especially big-ticket purchases into EMI and can also convert merchant transactions into EMI.Generally, these plans have very attractive interest rates and different repayment tenures. The EMI conversion will be done with no other documentation and most of the times instant.</p><p><strong>Lifestyle Benefits:</strong> By partnering with various merchants, credit card issuers provide attractive discounts and offers on various lifestyle categories including dining, shopping, travel, wellness, entertainment, etc.</p><p><strong>Travel Benefits:</strong> Frequent travellers can make the best use of the travel credit cards that provide travel-related benefits to the cardholders.

Here are a few tips to help you use your credit card:</p><ul><li><strong>Keep track of your spending:</strong> You can do this by making note of each transaction or by using any free mobile application.</li><li><strong>Pay your bills on time:</strong> Paying your bills on time means that you don't incur any interest on the amount. The worst thing you can do with your card is to default on your payments. This doesn't just lead to you having to pay interest, but your credit score ends up taking a hit as well.</li><li><strong>Pay your bills in full:</strong> If you don't pay your bills in full, you lose out in two ways. One – you have to pay interest on the amount you don't pay and two – you lose out on any rewards those transactions earned.</li><li><strong>Redeem rewards:</strong> Redeem the rewards you earn since that is the best way to get the best out of your credit card.</li><li><strong>Check your card statement:</strong> Make it a habit to check your credit card statement each month. This way, you can immediately dispute any transaction.</li><li><strong>Consider not taking a credit card loan:</strong> Credit card loans or cash advances have a high rate of interest and no interest-free period. You are charged interest from the moment you withdraw money up until the time you repay the entire amount.</li></ul>"

In most cases, banks will not consider this score to be ideal to offer you a credit card. However, if you have a credit score between 550 and 650, it might be considered poor credit. In these situations, if banks deem you as a responsible borrower, you might be qualified for an unsecured credit card.</p>"
