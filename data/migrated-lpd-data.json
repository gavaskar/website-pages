This follows a notification by the RBI, with the benchmark taking operating costs and current financial trends into account while computing the interest.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>MCLR Benchmark Tenure (Period)</strong></td><td><strong>Benchmark Rates (MCLR)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Overnight</td><td>8.45%</td></tr><tr><td>1 month</td><td>8.75%</td></tr><tr><td>3 months</td><td>8.95%</td></tr><tr><td>6 months</td><td>9.15%</td></tr><tr><td>1 year</td><td>9.25%</td></tr><tr><td>2 year</td><td>9.35%</td></tr><tr><td>3 year</td><td>9.45%</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Personal loan interest rates (MCLR)</h3><p>Standard Chartered Bank typically provides personal loans at a starting interest of 11.99% per annum. This means that a certain percentage will be added over and above the current MCLR benchmark, with the final interest determined after taking factors like the quantum of finance, borrower's relationship with the bank, repayment tenure, etc. into consideration.</p><h3>Standard Chartered Bank Base Rate (For existing borrowers)</h3><table><tbody><tr><td>Base Rate</td><td>9.50% per annum, effective October 5, 2015</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Standard Chartered Bank personal loan interest rate (Base Rate)</h3><p>Individuals who availed a loan before MCLR benchmarks were introduced can continue with their existing benchmark or migrate to MCLR. Borrowers who choose to continue with the base rate benchmark will be charged an additional interest over and above the current base rate. The final interest depends on a number of factors, with SC Bank having the authority to modify interest on a case to case basis.</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> All interest rates mentioned above are as of June 15, 2016. These rates are subject to change without prior notice, at the sole discretion of Standard Chartered Bank.

You will also be required to do proper research before you apply for a loan. Some of the important factors that should be kept in mind for getting a low interest rate include:</p><p><strong>Credit score - </strong>Making sure that your credit score it above par will result in you availing a loan at a fairly good interest rate. The better your CIBIL score the lower the interest rate added to the loan and vice versa.</p><p><strong>Down payment -</strong> Making a down payment upward of 20% of the loan amount will result in you availing a loan at a better interest rate. The bigger the down payment, the better the interest rate.</p><p><strong>Debt-to-income ratio -</strong> Always ensure that your EMIs, credit bills and other debts do not cross 40% of your annual or monthly income. Having a good debt-to-income ratio will boost your chances of availing a loan with a good interest rate.</p><p><strong>Loan shop - </strong>Financial portals such as BankBazaar is of great help when loan shopping. On the BankBazaar website, individuals can compare loan interest rates offered by its partner banks and can narrow down on a loan with the best interest rate relative to the tenure - one that suits their budget.</p><p><strong>Your employment and experience - </strong>This is one factor banks and NBFCs take into consideration when approving or rejecting a loan application. If you've had a stable income and worked for a reputed company, it's likely that you could very well negotiate on a decent interest rate.</p><p><strong>Make sure that you negotiate - </strong>Negotiating the interest rate on your loan is absolutely necessary. Most people just go ahead with the numbers set by banks and NBFCs, but making a negotiation will help you in the long run.</p><p><strong>Tenure - </strong>Choosing your tenure directly reflects on the interest rate added to the loan amount. Choosing a shorter tenure will result in you having a much less interest rate - though the EMIs will be considerably low. The interest rate increases with the length of the payback period.</p>"

While for some this might work perfectly, looking out for loans offered by numerous banks and NBFCs offering loans at the best interest rates is the best way forward. Other than that, there are a few other factors that will positively affect your loan interest rate. If you're availing a loan, listed below are a few areas you need to look into or take care of if you wish to get the lowest interest rate on your loan:</p><p><strong>Credit score - </strong>Ensuring that your credit score is optimum is imperative when availing a personal loan. Having a high credit score will result in you getting a loan at a lower interest rate and vice versa. A credit score above 750 is satisfactory when availing a personal loan.</p><p><strong>Make a down payment -</strong>Putting down a sizeable down payment is sure to get you a better interest rate on your loan. Anything upward of 20% of your loan amount will surely positively affect the interest rate that is offered to you.</p><p><strong>Debt-to-income ratio </strong>- Making sure that you have a stable debt-to-ratio will firstly decide whether your loan will be approved and secondly will affect the interest rate on your loan. Debt-to-ratio is the amount one earns against his/her credit bills, loans, etc.</p><p><strong>Look around for the best loan interest rates on offer - Facilitating </strong>the use of financial portals such as BankBazaar will help you when shopping around for loans offering the best interest rates. The BankBazaar website compares the loan interest rates of all its partner banks and makes it easier for customers to make a decision.</p><p><strong>Tenure - </strong>Choosing your tenure directly reflects on the interest rate added to the loan amount. Choosing a shorted tenure will result in you having a much less interest rate - though the <a href=\"/finance-tools/emi-calculator.html\" title=\"Check your Loan EMI Online\">EMIs </a>will considerably low. The interest rate increases with the length of the payback period.</p><p><strong>Employee stability and the company you work for - </strong>The number of years of experience and the company you work for plays a vital role whether firstly your loan will be approved and secondly the interest rate on the loan. Working for an established company only increases the bank's trust of you repaying the loan.</p><p><strong>Always negotiate - </strong>While most people readily agree to the interest rate on the loan offered by the bank, negotiating on the interest rate is a necessity. If you're a customer availing a loan from the bank holding your salary, you have a better chance of making a negotiation.</p>"

While for some this might work perfectly, comparing the interest rate on loans offered by several banks and NBFCs is the best option. Other than that, there are a few other factors that will positively affect your loan interest rate. If you're availing a loan, listed below are a few areas you need to look into or take care of if you wish to get the lowest interest rate on your loan:</p><p><strong>Credit score - </strong>Ensuring that your credit score is optimum is imperative when availing a personal loan. Having a high credit score will result in you getting a loan at a lower interest rate and vice versa. A credit score above 750 is satisfactory when availing a personal loan.</p><p><strong>Make a down payment -</strong> Putting down a sizeable down payment is sure to <a href=\"/personal-loan-interest-rate.html\" title=\"Best Personal Loan Interest Rates\">get you a better interest rate on your loan</a>. Anything upward of 20% of your loan amount will positively affect the interest rate that is offered to you.</p><p><strong>Debt-to-income ratio </strong>- Making sure that you have a stable debt-to-ratio will firstly decide whether your loan will be approved and secondly will affect the interest rate on your loan. Debt-to-ratio is the amount one earns on a monthly basis against his/her credit bills, loans dues, etc.</p><p><strong>Look around for the best loan interest rates on offer - Facilitating</strong> the use of financial portals such as BankBazaar will help you when shopping around for loans from various banks and NBFCs offering the best interest rates. The BankBazaar website compares the loan interest rates of all its partner banks and makes it easier for customers to make a decision.</p><p><strong>Tenure - </strong>Choosing your tenure directly reflects on the interest rate added to the loan amount. Choosing a shorter tenure will result in you having a much less interest rate - though the EMIs will be considerably high. The interest rate increases with the length of the payback period.</p><p><strong>Employee stability and the company you work for - </strong>The number of years of experience and the company you work for plays a vital role whether firstly your loan will be approved and secondly the interest rate on the loan. Working for an established company only increases the bank's trust of you repaying the loan.</p><p><strong>Always negotiate - </strong>While most people readily agree to the interest rate on the loan offered by the bank, negotiating on the interest rate is a necessity. If you're a customer availing a loan from the bank holding your salary, you have a better chance of making a negotiation.</p>"

The problem with this approach is that getting the best interest rate for the loan becomes almost far-fetched. Looking into all aspects of a personal loan before availing it is absolutely necessary. If you wish to avail a loan at the lowest interest, here are a few key areas you will have to look into:</p><p><strong>Credit score - </strong>Making sure that your credit score is above par will result in you availing a loan at a fairly good interest rate. The better your <a href=\"/credit-score.html\" title=\"Check your CIBIL Score\">CIBIL score</a> the lower the interest rate added to the loan and vice versa.</p><p><strong>Down payment -</strong> Making a down payment upward of 20% of the loan amount will result in you availing a loan at a better interest rate. The bigger the down payment, the better the interest rate.</p><p><strong>Debt-to-income ratio -</strong> Always ensure that your EMIs, credit bills and so on, do not cross 40% of your annual or monthly income. Having a good debt-to-income ratio will boost your chances of availing a loan with a good interest rate.</p><p><strong>Loan shop - </strong>Financial portals such as BankBazaar are of great help when loan shopping. On the BankBazaar website, individuals can compare loan interest rates offered by its partner banks and can narrow down on a loan with the best interest rate relative to the tenure - one that suits their budget.</p><p><strong>Your employment and experience - </strong>This is one factor banks and NBFCs take into consideration when approving or rejecting a loan application. If you've had a stable income and work for a reputed company, it's likely that you could very well negotiate on a decent interest rate.</p><p><strong>Make sure that you negotiate - </strong>Negotiating the interest rate on your loan is absolutely necessary. Most people just go ahead with the numbers set by banks and NBFCs, but making a negotiation will help you in the long run.</p><p><strong>Tenure - </strong>Choosing your tenure directly reflects on the interest rate added to the loan amount. Choosing a shorted tenure will result in you having a much less interest rate.</p>"

                                "body": "<p>UCO Bank offers a host of personal loan schemes to eligible borrowers, with the interest varying according to the scheme. Benchmarks adopted by the bank help in computing this interest, with two benchmarks currently in use. While interest rates computed according to base rates have been used for a while, MCLR benchmarks were introduced recently, following RBI directives.</p><h3>UCO Bank Marginal Cost of Funds Based Lending Rate (MCLR) (For new borrowers)</h3><p>UCO Bank introduced MCLR based benchmarks following RBI directives, with these benchmarks offering a better picture of current financial conditions. Factors like CRR, repo rate, loan tenure, operating costs, etc. have a direct correlation with MCLR, with any change in these parameters having an impact on rates payable by a borrower. The table below highlights the rates applicable as of June 2016.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>MCLR Benchmark Tenure (Period)</strong></td><td><strong>Benchmark Rates (MCLR)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Overnight</td><td>8.10%</td></tr><tr><td>1 month</td><td>8.20%</td></tr><tr><td>3 months</td><td>8.30%</td></tr><tr><td>6 months</td><td>8.55%</td></tr><tr><td>1 year</td><td>8.65%</td></tr><tr><td>2 years</td><td>9.65%</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Personal loan interest rates (MCLR)</h3><p>As per RBI guidelines, all consumers who avail a loan after April 1, 2016 will automatically fall under the ambit of MCLR. UCO Bank can choose to add a certain spread over and above this benchmark, with the final interest generally varying from case to case. The loan amount, repayment tenure, repayment mode (salary account with/without check-off), borrower income, etc. can all play a role in computing the final interest rate.</p><h3>UCO Bank Base and Prime Lending Rates (For existing borrowers)</h3><p>The base and prime lending rates at UCO Bank are highlighted below.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Base Rate</td><td>9.70% per annum, effective October 5, 2015</td></tr><tr><td>Prime Lending Rate</td><td>14.25% per annum, effective October 5, 2015</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>UCO Bank personal loan interest rate (Base Rate)</h3><p>The date of loan approval plays a key role in determining the benchmark one falls under, with all borrowers who availed a loan before MCLR benchmarks were introduced having an option to choose their interest mode. They can either continue paying interest determined by factoring the base rate or move to MCLR. Those who refrain from migrating will pay an interest according to the loan scheme, with rates typically ranging between <strong>12% per annum and 16% per annum</strong>. This is computed by adding a spread over the base rate, with it possible for one to avail preferential rates based on their relationship with the bank.</p><p><em>Note: UCO Bank reserves the right to change the aforementioned interest rates at its own discretion. All rates mentioned above are effective as of June 2016. Individuals looking to avail a loan from the bank are advised to check rates prevailing at the time of application.</em></p><p>Find more details about <strong><a href=\"/uco-bank-personal-loan-interest-rates.html\" title=\"UCO Personal Loan Interest rates\">UCO Personal Loan Interest rates</a></strong></p>"

Make sure that your ratio of secured loans to unsecured loans is good as the bank will consider you more responsible in this case. You must also make sure that you don't make loan applications with too many banks as it can reduce your credit score. Your job status also plays a crucial role. Make sure that you don't change jobs frequently as steady jobs and regular income are instrumental in the approval of a personal loan. The bank will only consider customers who have a steady job and are certain to draw an income that will help them clear their personal loan.</p>"

However, if your credit score is lower than 750, you could try some alternative ways of getting your loan approved. You could furnish a collateral to assure your lender that you will repay your loan promptly. If you are earning a high income, you could show your income proof to ensure that you will be able to pay this loan without any struggle albeit your low credit score.

The format and information provided in your application letter plays a vital role in having a personal loan sanctioned as well as the <a href=\"/personal-loan-interest-rate.html\">interest rate offered on the loan amount</a>. Personal loans can be quite easy to apply for with a hassle-free procedure. But there are a few factors that you will have to address and be cautious about when applying for a loan. A good credit score is a key factor and plays a vital role when applying for a loan. A credit score of 750 and above is considered as a good credit score to have and this plays a big role in getting your application for a personal loan approved. The interest rate is also dependent on this criteria. A credit score that is higher than the benchmark that has been set by banks and lenders will fetch a lower interest rate for your loan and vice-versa. If you have a bad credit score, you should do what you can to improve it. This can be done through a number of different ways. Paying off any unpaid premiums or loans is a good way to increase your score.</p><p>Another important point to take into consideration is that you should make sure that you do an ample amount of research the loan amount that you require and the bank with which you wish to apply for a loan. You have to have a clear idea about the banking institution that you want to apply for a loan to as well as the amount that you need to borrow from the bank. You can avoid paying an extra amount of money towards the interest levied on a loan amount by ensuring that you do not apply for a loan that exceeds your financial needs. On the other hand, if you borrow an amount that does not meet your financial needs, you might end up applying for another loan amount. This can pose a big problem as managing two loans can be quite risky. You could end up missing out on a payment which would lead to a drastic drop in your credit score.</p>"

Most people, blindly avail loans from the banks holding their salary account and leave all the calculations and assessments to be made by the bank. For first-timers, these are the areas you need to look into and improve if you wish to avail a <a href=\"/personal-loan-interest-rate.html\" title=\"Personal Loan Rate of Interest\">personal loan at the lowest interest rate</a> possible.</p><p><strong>Credit score - </strong>The credit score of the individual directly influences the interest rate that the bank will offer you when availing a loan. If the credit score is good (anything above 750), the interest rate offered by the bank will be low. If the credit score is below 750, the bank will place a higher interest rate on the loan.</p><p><strong>Down payment - </strong>Making a down payment upwards of 20% of the loan amount will result in you getting a better interest rate on the personal loan.</p><p><strong>Debt-to-income ratio - </strong>When a bank or NBFC makes a verification of the credit profile of the loan applicant, the debt-to-income ratio is one of the first things that is taken into consideration. Having a debt-to-income ratio less than 40% of your monthly net income is ideal when availing a loan. If it is more than 40%, the bank might reject the loan application (based on your income) or might apply a higher interest rate if the application comes through.</p><p><strong>Loan shop - </strong>Facilitating the use of financial portal such as BankBazaar has made loan shopping easy. Using the BankBazaar website, individuals can compare loan offers from different banks and NBFCs and choose one that suits their financial situation. In addition, customers can even make <a href=\"/finance-tools/emi-calculator.html\" title=\"EMI Calculator\">EMI calculations</a> and check their CIBIL score on the website.</p><p><strong>Experience and employer -</strong> The number of years of experience you have and the company you work for affects the bank's decision to either give you a higher or lower interest rate. Working for a reputed company will increase the bank's trust in you making the repayment in time.</p><p><strong>Negotiate -</strong> One of the more important aspects when availing a loan is to negotiate with the bank executives on the interest rate of the loan you wish to take out. Making a negotiation might just get you an ideal interest rate on your loan.</p>"

The interest rate applicable to your credit will depend upon the lender from whom you choose to borrow. However, before you try to apply for a personal loan, it is very important to check your creditworthiness. Your credit score is directly proportional to your interest rate in the sense that the higher you're score, the lower your interest rate and vice-versa. A good credit rating can help you not only avail the amount you require, but will also open the door to availing a relatively low and affordable interest rate. Credit scores that exceed 750 will make it considerably easy for you to get a high amount at a relatively low interest rate. It is also instrumental to carefully assess your financial requirements before drafting an application for a personal loan as borrowing a high amount that you don't fully need will mean that you will have to deal with paying extra interest. Similarly, borrowing a lower amount and utilising it without meeting your personal requirements will mean that you may end up taking another loan to meet your requirements, thereby paying interest on the second loan as well. Make sure that you have assessed how much money you need as it will help in avoiding unnecessary expenditure towards interest payments.</p>"

Given below are some of the main factors that affect your personal loan approval:</p><ul><li><strong>Credit history of the borrower: </strong>Ensure that you have cleared all your outstanding loan payments before applying for a new loan. Also, ensure that your credit history is updated by the lending organization once you have cleared the payments. With a good credit score, the chances of availing a personal loan are higher. Generally, a credit score above 750 is considered good.</li><li><strong>Down payments:</strong> Paying an amount upfront while availing a loan can have a significant impact on your EMIs. An amount higher than 20% of the loan value is likely to bring down your interest rates considerably.</li><li><strong>Debt-to-income ratio:</strong> Debt-to-income-ratio is the ratio of how much you owe the bank each month to your monthly income. It is one of the key factors which decide your <a href=\"/personal-loan-eligibility.html\" title=\"Personal Loan Eligibility\">personal loan eligibility</a>. Check your debt-to-income ratio before applying for a personal loan.</li><li><strong>Comparing loans: </strong>A knowledge of the best loan products available in the market can help you when shopping for loans. Through third-party websites like BankBazaar, you can check the interest rates of different banks and compare the features side-by-side.</li><li><strong>Tenure: </strong>Your loan tenure is directly proportional to your Equated Monthly Installments (EMIs). So, choose a shorter loan tenure to avail a lower rate of interest.</li><li><strong>Employment status: </strong>Companies also check your employment history while approving personal loans. If your employer is listed with the bank you approach for loan, then it's not just easy to avail the loan but you can also get a lower rate of interest.</li><li><strong>Personal loan negotiation: </strong>Do not settle for the interest rates offered by the bank. Always try to negotiate and reduce the EMIs. If you are applying for a loan at the bank where maintain your salary account, then you can easily negotiate as you are a preferred customer of the bank.</li></ul><table><thead><tr><th>Bank</th><th>Interest Rate Range</th><th>Processing Fee Range</th><th>Loan Amount</th><th>Tenure</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ICICI Bank</td><td>11.59% - 18.49% (Fixed)</td><td>2.25% (min.

A good credit score is a key factor and this plays a vital role when applying for a loan. A credit score of 750 and above is considered as a good credit score to have and this plays a big role in getting your application for a personal loan approved. The interest rate that is levied on a personal loan also depends on this criteria. A credit score that is higher than the benchmark that has been set by banks and lenders will fetch a lower interest rate for your loan and vice-versa. If you have a bad credit score, you should do what you can to improve it. This can be done through a number of different ways. Paying off any unpaid premiums or loans is a good way to increase your score.</p><p>You, as a borrower, should conduct your own research and make sure that you apply for a loan amount that covers your financial needs and requirements.

                        "body": "<p>A personal loan is taken for a personal financial need and the bank is not liable to monitor its usage. A low EMI on personal loan does not necessarily mean that you are paying a lower amount in the long run.</p><p>A low EMI usually results from a long repayment term, low interest rate, or a combination of the two. In certain instances, you may even pay a higher interest to your lender when you opt for a lower EMI. Using online tools like the <a href=\"/personal-loan-emi-calculator.html\" title=\"Personal Loan Calculator\">Personal Loan EMI Calculator</a> is beneficial as it helps you understand your interest payout for the loan tenure and your capacity to repay the loan before you take it.</p><p>You can also compare loans and identify the banks that offer the lowest rates. Getting a low interest rate helps you save money over the loan tenure. The following points indicate the ways in which you can secure a loan with a low interest rate in Dehradun:</p><ol><li><strong>Display creditworthiness </strong>- You would first have to understand the importance of your credit score and the role it plays in the sanction of a loan. Your credit score depends on your credit history, and is hence, a measurement of your ability to repay a loan. If you have a low credit score, this is an indication to the lender that you may be unable to repay your loan. This puts you in the high risk bracket for a personal loan. To compensate for this risk, the lender charges a high interest rate on your loan.<p>Customers will be able to check their credit scores online at any of the credit reporting bureaus, i.e., TransUnion/CIBIL, Experian, and Equifax. It is possible to get your credit score for free, in case you do not require an elaborate report. Having a high credit score (above 700) is an indicator of your creditworthiness.</p></li><li><strong>Improve your credit score </strong>- If you have a low credit score, you can attempt to improve it. In case you are able to wait for a few months (or even years) before availing a personal loan, you can build a better credit before the loan application. In line with this, you can negotiate with lenders or inculcate better spending habits to improve your <a href=\"/credit-score.html\" title=\"Check Free Credit Score\">credit score</a>. In order to improve your creditworthiness, you will have to make your EMI payments on time on a consistent basis. When you follow this for a few years, you will significantly improve your credit score.</li><li><strong>Getting better terms on your loans </strong>- As mentioned above, some banks enable you to avail a personal loan with a lower interest rate if you provide a collateral under the debt. The collateral can be an expensive asset, like property or a car. This way of getting a personal loan is more beneficial to individuals with a low credit score. After you have pledged as collateral against a loan, in case you are unable to repay the loan, the lender takes possession of the asset.<ul><li>You can also consider taking a floating rate personal loan, where the interest rate increases when the prime lending rate goes up.</li><li>You can request a family member or a friend to co-sign your loan. This is advantageous when your co-signer has a good credit score.</li><li>Additionally, you can compare personal loan rates across banks and narrow down on a good deal by utilising the loan comparison facility online. Several third-party financial websites offer this service, and it is available free of cost.</li></ul></li></ol>"

Therefore, only a small portion of your principal amount is paid off in the initial loan repayment period. As you progress further on the EMI payments, the interest on the outstanding amount would have reduced to a large extent. Hence, a larger part of the EMI is used to pay off the loan principal.</p>"

To ensure that you avail a loan at the lowest interest rate possible, you'd have to look into these components.</p><p><strong>Credit score: </strong>If by chance your credit score is below 750, banks usually offer personal loans at a higher interest rate. The higher your credit score, the lower will be the interest rate offered to you by the bank or the NBFC. A credit score of 750 plus is ideal when availing a personal loan.</p><p><strong>Down payment: </strong>Making an upfront down payment anything above 20% of the total loan amount will result in the bank offering you a lower interest rate. Most people make the mistake of not making a down payment towards the loan, resulting in the bank or NBFC offering you a loan at a higher interest rate.</p><p><strong>Debt-to-income ratio: </strong>Banks and NBFCs in most cases reject the application of a customer if the debt-to-income ratio exceeds 50% as it reduces the bank's trust in your repaying the loan amount. A debt-to-income ration anything less than 40% of your net monthly income will result in the bank or NBFC offering you a personal loan at a better interest rate.</p><p><strong>Loan shopping:</strong> Financial portals such as Bank Bazaar aid customers when deciding on where to avail a loan from as they compare the loan offers (with the interest rate, processing fee, etc.) of all its partner banks and displays the bank or NBFC offering <a href=\"/personal-loan-interest-rate.html\">personal loans at the lowest interest rate</a>. Always ensure that you make comparisons for loan offers from different banks and NBFCs before availing a loan.</p><p><strong>Your company's reputation and your experience: </strong>Having a decent number of years of experience as well as working for a reputed company enhances the bank's trust in your repaying the loan in time, thereby positively affecting the interest rate added to the personal loan.</p><p><strong>Negotiating: </strong>Having a good relationship with the bank will increase your chances of getting a lower interest rate added to your loan. You could also try getting the loan processing fee waived.</p>"

Listed below are some ways in which you can get a low interest rate on your personal loan in Gurgaon and avoid a large debt:</p><ol><li><strong>Display creditworthiness </strong>- You have to first understand why your credit score is crucial for availing a loan. Based on your debt history, your credit score will measure your creditworthiness, and hence, the repayment possibility. Having a low credit score indicates that you may not pay your loan back, and hence, it poses a risk to lenders. In such a scenario, the lender compensates the risk by charging a higher interest rate on the loan.<p>Customers can check their credit scores online at the websites of any of the three credit reporting bureaus, TransUnion/CIBIL, Experian, and Equifax. It is possible to get your credit score for free. If your credit score is a high value, it shows your creditworthiness. A score of 700 is a good value.</p></li><li><strong>Improve your credit score </strong>- If your credit score is a low value, then you can consider improving it, but you will have to think about how long you can wait before availing the loan. If you can afford to wait for some months or even years, then it is wise to build a better credit before initiating the loan application.<p>Those with low credit scores can negotiate with lenders or implement better spending habits to boost their credit score. You can also attempt to repair your credit history and remove the damaging entry on your credit report. In order to build a good credit report, you will have to consistently make your EMI payments in full and on time, for months or even years.</p></li><li><strong>Getting better terms on your loans </strong>- Some banks offer personal loans with better interest rates when an asset is secured under the debt as a collateral. So, if you have a valuable asset, such as an equity or a car, you can get a lower interest rate on your personal loan if you secure it with that asset. In such a situation, if you are unable to repay your loan, the lender can take possession of the asset as compensation. Loans with a collateral are also easier to get, particularly for those with bad credit.<p>You can also consider taking a loan with a floating loan rate, where the interest rate increases with the prime lending rates. Alternatively, you can ask a family member or a friend to co-sign your loan. This way, you can avail a loan on their creditworthiness. Comparing rates of loans across various lenders is a great way to understand the best offers from banks. You can utilise the loan comparison facility offered by neutral third-party financial websites for the same.</p></li></ol>"

You need to check out the rates, fees, and other charges, and pick the most affordable loan. This can be done online with the help of your smartphone, laptop, or computer. All you need to do is check out the brochures of loan products on lenders' websites or visit third-party financial websites to compare and contrast interest rates.</li><li><strong>Maintain a decent credit score:</strong> After you finalise on a loan and decide to approach a lender, you need to take care of one step to proceed further. You must make sure that your credit score is maintained well. This score is given by credit bureau agencies depending on your credit behaviour. The score should ideally be 750 or above. In case your credit score is low at the time of applying for a particular personal loan, your chances of getting your loan approved will be pretty low. Hence, if you have a pretty poor score, put in that little extra effort to boost it by being properly financially disciplined. You can then apply for a loan for a better result.</li><li><strong>Job status:</strong> Your lender may actually do a background check of your job details to make sure that you have a steady source of income. You can also provide a proof of your income and proof of employment to show how much you are earning. This can be done by showing your most recent payslips, bank statements, offer letter, relieving letter, etc. Moreover, if your lender has collaborated with any of your employers, you may get preferential or special rates of interest for your personal loan.</li></ul>"

You could also present a security or collateral as it will reduce the risk of your lender. In case you got an increment in your salary, you can display your income proof to show that you can afford to repay the loan promptly. You may also combine your spouse's income to boost your loan eligibility.</p>"

Customers need to look at all the components that affect the overall interest rate added to the personal loan. To ensure that you are offered a loan at the lowest possible interest rate, one will have to look at the below mentioned components that affect the interest rate.</p><p><strong>Credit score: </strong>A credit score of 750 plus is ideal when availing a personal loan. If your credit score is below 750, banks usually offer personal loans at a higher interest rate. The higher your credit score, the lower will be the interest rate offered to you by the bank or the NBFC.</p><p><strong>Down payment: </strong>Making an upfront down payment anything north of 20% of the total loan amount will result in the bank offering you a lower interest rate.</p><p><strong>Debt-to-income ratio: </strong>Banks and NBFCs usually prefer for the loan applicant's debt-to-income ratio to be below 40% or 50%. If it above, in most cases reject the application as it reduces the bank's trust in your repaying the loan amount in time. Having a debt-to-income ratio anything less than 40% of your net monthly income will result in the bank or NBFC offering you a <a href=\"/personal-loan-interest-rate.html\">personal loan at the best possible interest rate</a>.</p><p><strong>Loan shopping: </strong>Financial portals such as Bank Bazaar aid customers when it comes to choosing a loan as they compare the loan offers (with the interest rate, processing fee, etc.) of all its partner banks and displays the bank or NBFC offering personal loans at the lowest interest rate.</p><p><strong>Your company's reputation and your experience: </strong>When availing a personal loan, having a good number of years of experience as well as working for a reputed company is a big bonus as it enhances the bank's trust in your repaying the loan in time.</p><p><strong>Negotiating:</strong> Making a negotiation with the bank availing you a loan on the interest rate might just get you a better deal.

You will also need to prove your creditworthiness to your lender. For this, you will have to maintain a good credit score. A typical good credit score is anything above 750/900. Your lender may also check your job situation. If you have been shifting jobs on a frequent basis, the lender may not trust you to repay the loan on time. Therefore, before you apply for a personal loan, make sure you have been in a job for a reasonably long period. This will establish that you have a regular source of income and that you will be able to make your loan EMIs along with your other monthly expenditures. You should also fix your personal loan amount as per your financial situation. You should ensure that you do not borrow an extremely high amount as you should not have to struggle to pay your installment amounts. Struggling to make repayments can also lead to defaults of loans, which is very bad for your credit score.</p><p>By following these tips, you can get an economical interest rate for your personal loan.</p>"

The way you draft your application letter plays a vital role in having a personal loan sanctioned as well as the interest rate offered on the loan amount. The interest rate that is offered will depend entirely on the lender who sanctions the loan to you. Though a personal loan is easy to apply for, you should be cautious when applying for one. A good credit score plays a vital role in applying for a loan. A credit score of 750 and above is considered as a good credit score to have and this plays a big role in getting your application for a personal loan approved. The interest rate is also dependent on this criteria. A higher credit score will fetch a lower interest rate and vice-versa. If you have a bad credit score, you should do what you can to increase it. Paying off any unpaid premiums or loans is a good way to increase your score.</p><p>You should also make sure that you do an ample amount of research before you apply for a loan amount with a bank. You have to have a clear idea about the banking institution that you want to <a href=\"/personal-loan.html\">apply for a loan</a> to as well as the amount that you need to borrow from the bank. If you end up borrowing an amount that exceeds the amount that you really require to meet your needs, you will end up paying an extra amount to the banking institution as interest. If you borrow an amount that falls short of meeting your needs, you might end up applying for another loan amount. This can become a hassle as managing two loans can be quite risky. You could end up missing out on a payment which would lead to a drastic drop in your credit score.</p>"

You will have to make sure that you application for a loan is drafted in such a way that it should help you get a good interest rate from the lender. The interest rate ranges from lender to lender and is completely dependent on them when you're applying for the loan. Though personal loans are easy to apply for in Lucknow, it should be noted that the lender has the last say on whether they should accept or reject the loan application. This is why it is very important that you do what is needed to make sure that you loan application is as appealing as it should be. A good credit score can also increase your chances of having a loan sanctioned. A credit score of 750 and above is considered to be a good score in the eyes of the lender as this score shows the lender your potential of paying back the loan. The interest rate offered by the lender is drastically affected by you credit score. The interest rate offered by the lender is directly proportional to the credit score which means that a high credit score can fetch you a lower interest rate and vice versa. This is why it is really important that you maintain a good credit score no matter what.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind when applying for a personal loan is to make sure that you assess your finances to avoid applying for a loan amount that either meets your financial needs or falls short of it. If you end up borrowing an amount that you will not require, you will end up paying a larger amount of money to the lender as interest. Similarly, if you end up borrowing a lower amount, you might fall short of funds and you may end up taking out another loan to meet your needs and requirements. Therefore, it is important that you do your research, find the bank that offers the best interest rate, and then apply for loan amount that would be an adequate amount to fulfil your needs and requirements.</p>"

If you're availing a loan, listed below are a few areas you need to look into or take care of if you wish to get the lowest interest rate on your loan:</p><p><strong>Credit score - </strong>Ensuring that your credit score is optimum is imperative when availing a personal loan. Having a high credit score will result in you getting a loan at a lower interest rate and vice versa. A credit score above 750 is satisfactory when availing a personal loan.</p><p><strong>Make a down payment -</strong> Putting down a sizeable down payment is sure to get you a better interest rate on your loan. Anything upward of 20% of your loan amount will positively affect the interest rate that is offered to you.</p><p><strong>Debt-to-income ratio </strong>- Making sure that you have a stable debt-to-ratio will firstly decide whether your loan will be approved and secondly will affect the interest rate on your loan. Debt-to-ratio is the amount one earns monthly against his/her credit bills, loans dues, etc.</p><p><strong>Look around for the best loan interest rates on offer - Facilitating</strong> the use of financial portals such as BankBazaar will help you when shopping around for loans from various banks and NBFCs offering the best interest rates. The BankBazaar website compares the loan interest rates of all its partner banks and makes it easier for customers to make a decision.</p><p><strong>Tenure - </strong>Choosing your tenure directly reflects on the interest rate added to the loan amount. Choosing a shorter tenure will result in you having a much less interest rate - though the EMIs will be considerably high. The interest rate increases with the length of the payback period.</p><p><strong>Employee stability and the company you work for - </strong>The number of years of experience and the company you work for plays a vital role whether firstly your loan will be approved and secondly the interest rate on the loan. Working for an established company only increases the bank's trust of you repaying the loan.</p><p><strong>Always negotiate - </strong>While most people readily agree to the interest rate on the loan offered by the bank, negotiating on the interest rate is a necessity. If you're a customer availing a loan from the bank holding your salary, you have a better chance of making a negotiation.</p>"

If the credit score is good (anything above 750), the interest rate offered by the bank will be low.

Having a debt-to-income ratio less than 40% of your monthly net income is ideal when availing a loan.

Working for a reputed company will increase the bank's trust in you making the repayment in time.</p><p><strong>Negotiate -</strong> One of the more important aspects when availing a loan is to negotiate with the bank executives on the interest rate of the loan you wish to take out. Making a negotiation might just get you an ideal interest rate on your loan.</p>"

                        "body": "<p>When applying for a personal loan, it is important to research well and narrow down on a lender who offers a low interest rate. The personal loan interest rate determines the amount that you would be paying as monthly installments for the repayment of the loan. Getting the best interest rate hence, ensures that the total amount paid towards the loan in the long run is minimised. Follow the tips mentioned below to avail a great deal on your personal loan:</p><ol><li><strong>Maintain a good credit score</strong> - Your credit score plays a crucial role in determining your repayment capacity for the loan. If you have a low credit score, i.e. Below 700, the lender considers your loan as a high-risk debt. To compensate for the risk, the bank would charge a higher interest rate.</li><ul><li>In the ideal scenario, you would have to assess your credit score and understand your creditworthiness before you apply for a personal loan. You can check your credit score absolutely free of cost at the websites of credit reporting bureaus such as CIBIL, Equifax, and Experian. Neutral third-party financial websites also offer you the facility of checking your credit score online.</li><li>If your credit score is a low value, then you can attempt to improve it before loan application. However, you should first understand if you can afford to wait for a few years before getting the loan. This is because the task of improving your credit score would usually take a few years.</li><li>Individuals with low credit scores can get into an agreement with past lenders and pay off their pending loans. Another way to improve your credit report is to make consistent payments towards your debts, in full and on time.</li></ul><li><strong>Getting a better interest rate on your loan</strong> - There are banks that offer personal loans with more attractive interest rates when a collateral is offered as security. So, if a customer has a valuable asset such as a car or a house, he/she can pledge the asset with the bank for a better loan rate. A secured personal loan has the disadvantage of losing the asset in the event of a loan repayment failure. In this scenario, the lender takes possession of the pledged asset in the form of compensation. However, a secured loan is much more appropriate for a customer who has bad credit. An applicant can also opt for any of the following in order to avail a loan with better interest rate:<ul><li>Taking a loan with a floating rate of interest which increases with the prime lending rate.</li><li>Requesting a family member or a friend to stand as a co-applicant. This is an ideal option if the primary applicant has a bad credit score. He/she can avail the loan on the creditworthiness of the co-signer.</li><li>Compare the personal loan interest rates across lenders in order to identify the ones that offer the best deal. It is possible to do so through neutral third-party financial websites.</li></ul></li></ol>"

The charges incurred for prepayment of a personal loan in Mysore is usually between 2% and 5% of the outstanding loan amount. Some banks also restrict the prepayment to be done after the borrower has paid a certain number of EMIs.</p><p>Loan preclosure refers to the borrower paying off the loan completely before the loan tenure ends. Preclosure charges range from 2% to 5% of the loan amount.</p>"

                    "answer": "<p>The larger portion of the EMIs you pay are adjusted against the interest that is due on your personal loan. This process, commonly referred to as front loading, pays off only a small portion of your principal amount initially. However, as you progress further into the loan repayment period, the interest on the outstanding loan amount would have been almost completely paid off. Then a larger part of the EMI you pay is adjusted against the loan principal.</p>"

                    "answer": "<p>Unlike a fixed interest on your personal loan, a floating interest rate ensures that the EMIs decrease as you progress further into the loan repayment tenure. A floating interest loan follows the reducing balance method of interest calculation. The latest MCLR rules indicate that floating rates can be altered either half-yearly or annually.</p>"

Choose the right lender who offers you loan terms which closely fit your needs. Before applying for the loan, ensure that you have a high credit score (above 750/900), which usually the biggest factor is determining the interest rate a lender charges you. The lower your score, the higher your personal loan interest rate is likely to be.</p><p>Also, assess your requirements before you apply for the loan and take only the amount that you need and no more. If you do not estimate your requirements, you could end up taking a loan for an amount which is higher than what you need and you will still be required to pay interest on the higher loan amount. If you take a loan for a lower amount than what you need, you might have to end up taking another loan, and then will have to pay interest for that as well.</p><p>Most importantly, you must compare different personal loan options before you finalise on one. You must certainly check out the rates of interest for each loan option and then select one that suits your preferences and requirements. Checking online is the best way to compare and contrast interest rates for loans. It is free of cost and you can do this while sitting on your bed at home or while sitting at your office desk, or even while commuting to your favourite coffee shop! This step will help you have a smooth borrowing process throughout your tenure as this step will enable you to make a fool-proof decision.</p><p>If you know that your employer has partnered with any bank or non-banking financial company (<a href=\"/personal-loan/nbfcs.html\">NBFC</a>) for loans and other financial products, you should most certainly approach this lender. When you choose this lender, you may be fortunate enough to receive special rates of interest for your personal loan. Moreover, you may be able to enjoy some additional discounts and other benefits too!</p>"

The interest rate applicable to your credit will depend upon the lender from whom you choose to borrow. However, before you try to apply for a personal loan, it is very important to check your creditworthiness. A good credit rating can help you not only avail the amount you require, but will also open the door to availing a relatively low and affordable interest rate. Credit scores that exceed 750 will make it considerably easy for you to get a high amount at a relatively low interest rate. Your credit score is directly proportional to your interest rate in the sense that the higher you're score, the lower your interest rate and vice-versa. It is also instrumental to carefully assess your financial requirements before drafting an application for a personal loan as borrowing a high amount that you don't fully need will mean that you will have to deal with paying extra interest. Similarly, borrowing a lower amount and utilising it without meeting your personal requirements will mean that you may end up taking another loan to meet your requirements, thereby paying interest on the second loan as well. Make sure that you have assessed how much money you need as it will help in avoiding unnecessary expenditure towards interest payments.</p>"

Since personal loans are unsecured, your credit worthiness acts as your security. The higher your credit score, the lower your interest rate is likely to be.</p><p><strong>Choose Carefully</strong> – There are a large number of lenders who will be willing to provide a personal loan to you. However, make your choice carefully and select the one which closely fits your requirements.</p><p><strong>Assess Your Need Before</strong> – Before you apply for a personal loan, calculate the amount that you actually need. Since interest on personal loans is usually higher than other loans, a higher than necessary loan amount means that you will have to pay interest on it as well.</p>"

Customers generally make the mistake of choosing the bank holding their salary account without actually loan shopping. While in this case the paperwork would be relaxes, availing a loan at the best rate might not be the case. Customers need to look at certain components before availing a personal loan - components that affect the overall interest rate added to the personal loan. If you wish to <a href=\"/personal-loan-interest-rate.html\">avail a loan at the lowest interest rate</a> possible, you'd have to look into these areas.</p><p><strong>Credit score: </strong>The higher your credit score, the lower will be the interest rate offered to you by the bank or the NBFC. A credit score of 750 plus is ideal when availing a personal loan. If your credit score is below 750, banks usually offer personal loans at a higher interest rate.</p><p><strong>Down payment: </strong>Making an upfront down payment anything above 20% of the total loan amount will result in the bank offering you a lower interest rate.</p><p><strong>Debt-to-income ratio: </strong>Depending on your salary, most banks and NBFCs usually prefer for the loan applicant's debt-to-income ratio to be below 40% or 50%. Banks and NBFCs in most cases reject the application of a customer if the debt-to-income ratio exceeds 50% as it reduces the bank's trust in your repaying the loan amount in time. Having a debt-to-income ratio anything less than 40% of your net monthly income will result in the bank or NBFC offering you a personal loan at a decent interest rate.</p><p><strong>Loan shopping: </strong>Making comparisons for loan offers from different banks and NBFCs is the right approach before availing a loan. Financial portals such as Bank Bazaar aid customers as they compare the loan offers (with the interest rate, processing fee, etc.) of all its partner banks and displays the bank or NBFC offering personal loans at the lowest interest rate.</p><p><strong>Your company's reputation and your experience: </strong>Having a decent number of years of experience as well as working for a reputed company enhances the bank's trust in your repaying the loan in time, thereby affecting the interest rate added to the personal loan. If you have worked many years at a stretch and work for a stable and well known company chances are that the bank will slash the interest rate added to your loan.</p><p><strong>Negotiating: </strong>Most people do not even know that this is a possibility, but making a negotiation with the bank availing you a loan on the interest rate might just get you a better deal. If you have a good past relationship with the bank, it's a good chance that the bank will give you the best interest rate possible.</p>"

You will have to make sure that you application for a loan is drafted in such a way that it should help you get a good interest rate from the lender. The interest rate ranges from lender to lender and is completely dependent on them when you're applying for the loan. Though personal loans are easy to apply for in Rajkot, it should be noted that the lender has the last say on whether they should accept or reject the loan application. This is why it is very important that you do what is needed to make sure that you loan application is as appealing as it should be. A good credit score can also increase your chances of having a loan sanctioned. A credit score of 750 and above is considered to be a good score in the eyes of the lender as this score shows the lender your potential of paying back the loan. The interest rate offered by the lender is drastically affected by you credit score. The interest rate offered by the lender is directly proportional to the credit score which means that a high credit score can fetch you a lower interest rate and vice versa. This is why it is really important that you maintain a good credit score no matter what.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind when applying for a personal loan is to make sure that you assess your finances to avoid applying for a loan amount that either meets your financial needs or falls short of it. If you end up borrowing an amount that you will not require, you will end up paying a larger amount of money to the lender as interest. Similarly, if you end up borrowing a lower amount, you might fall short of funds and you may end up taking out another loan to meet your needs and requirements. Therefore, it is important that you do your research, find the bank that offers the best interest rate, and then apply for loan amount that would be an adequate amount to fulfil your needs and requirements.</p>"

You will have to draft your application in a way where you are able to get a good interest rate from the bank. The interest rate that is offered will depend on the lender who you wish to borrow the sum of money from. Though <a href=\"/personal-loan.html\" title=\"Apply Personal Loan Now\">personal loans are easy to apply for</a>, it is very important that you check your credit score before applying for a loan. A good credit can not only help you get the loan amount that you desire, but also help you avail a good and affordable interest rate on the loan. A credit score that is 750 and above is considered as a good score and this will help you get a better deal on your loan. The interest rate offered by the financial institution that you approach is directly proportional to your credit score which means that a high credit score will avail a lower interest rate and vice-versa.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind when applying for a personal loan is to assess your financial requirements before applying for the loan. If you end up borrowing a high amount that you don't really need, you will end up paying extra money to the bank as interest. Similarly, if you borrow a lower sum, you will end up taking another personal loan to meet your needs which means you will have to pay an interest on another loan amount. Therefore, it is important that you access your needs and see how much financial banking you require to meet your needs to avoid paying any money towards interest that you could have avoided.</p>"

The interest rate is also dependent on this criteria. A credit score that is higher than the benchmark that has been set by banks and lenders will fetch a lower interest rate for your loan and vice-versa.

Paying off any unpaid premiums or loans is a good way to increase your score.</p><p>You should also make sure that you do an ample amount of research before you apply for a loan amount with a bank. You have to have a clear idea about the banking institution that you want to apply for a loan to as well as the amount that you need to borrow from the bank.

If you borrow an amount that falls short of meeting your needs, you might end up applying for another loan amount. This can become a hassle as managing two loans can be quite risky.

Most people leave the assessments and calculations (with regard to the interest rate) to bank executives. If you're new to availing personal loans, listed below are areas you would need to look into if you wish to avail a loan at the lowest possible interest rate.</p><p><strong>Credit score:</strong> The credit score directly reflects on the interest rate applied on the loan offered to you by the bank. The higher your credit score the lower will be the interest rate offered to you by the bank and vice versa. Having a credit score upwards of 750 is optimum when availing a loan will be beneficial.</p><p><strong>Down payment - </strong>When availing a personal loan, most people ignore the resultant effect a down payment has on the interest rate offered to them by the bank. Making a down payment north of 20% of the total loan amount will result in you availing a <a href=\"/personal-loan-interest-rate.html\" title=\"Personal Loan at Low Interest Rates\">loan at a lower interest rate</a>.</p><p><strong>Debt-to-income ratio - </strong>Before approving the loan application, one of the first things that banks and NBFCs take into consideration is the debt-to-income ratio of the applicant. Having a debt-to-income ratio below 40% is optimum. Having a debt-to-income ratio more than either 40% or 50% might result in your application being rejected or if approved (based on your income), the interest rate added on the loan will be relatively higher.</p><p><strong>Look around for the best loan offer: </strong>Rather than just going with the bank holding your salary account, it is important to look around for the bank or NBFC offering a loan that suits your financial ability. Loan shopping on financial portals such as BankBazaar will give you a clear-cut idea of the different interest rates offered by banks and NBFCs. The BankBazaar website compares loans offered by its partner banks and lays bare the best possible loan out there.</p><p><strong>Your experience and the company you work for: </strong>Working for a reputed company will only increase the bank's trust in you repaying the loan in time. The number of years of experience as well as the company you work for plays an important role in deciding the interest rate added on the loan.</p><p><strong>Negotiate: </strong>Making a negotiation for the interest rate added on your loan amount is a must. Most people do not even know that this is a possibility. Negotiating with the bank on the interest rate might just get you a better deal.</p>"

The lender from whom you choose to borrow will determine the interest rate applicable to your credit. But before drafting an application for a personal loan, it is essential to ensure that you have a good credit rating. Credit scores in excess of 750 will make it fairly easy for you to get a relatively high amount with a considerably low interest rate. The higher you're score, the lower your interest rate and vice-versa. It is also essential to carefully assess your financial requirements before applying for a loan as taking an amount higher than you need will mean that you will have to pay interest for an unnecessary sum. Similarly, taking an amount lower than your actual requirements will mean that you will probably have to avail another loan and thereby pay interest towards that as well.</p>"

This interest rate is determined by the lender from whom you wish to borrow the sum of money. An important step to follow is to make sure that you check your credit score before you apply for a personal loan. A credit score of 750 and above is considered to be good and this credit score will help you get a loan at a better interest rate. The interest rate offered by the financial institution that you approach is directly proportional to your credit score which means that a high credit score will avail a lower interest rate and vice-versa.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind when you are applying for a personal loan is to make sure that you assess your financial requirements before you apply for a personal loan. If you end up borrowing a high amount that you don't really need, you will have to pay extra money to the bank as interest. Similarly, if you borrow a lower sum, you will end up taking another personal loan to meet your needs which means you will have to pay an interest on another loan amount.</p>"

So, when you avail a personal loan, make sure you have a low interest rate as it will directly affect the EMI amount you are going to pay every month. The interest rate on your personal loan is determined by various factors. Before applying for a personal loan, you can make sure you have done the following things which will help you get a better interest rate on your loan:</p><ul><li><strong>Improve your credit score:</strong> The first thing a lender will see when you apply for a personal loan is your credit score. A credit score is a numerical expression that represents the creditworthiness of the borrower. Credit bureaus in India assign a credit score for every individual. The credit score is assigned based on your repayment history, your existing loans, and other factors. A credit score can range from 300 and 850. The higher the credit score, the higher your chances of getting a good deal on your personal loan. Before applying for a personal loan, make sure you know your credit score. If you do not have a decent credit score, make sure you close your existing loans if possible, clear your credit card bills, and avoid cheque bonuses and late payments.</li><li><strong>Get a co-signer: </strong>Ask a friend or your family member who has a high credit score to co-sign on your personal loan. This makes the loan less risky for the lender and will result in lower interest rates for you.</li><li><strong>Shop around for loans: </strong>Spend ample time to know more about the personal loans available in the market. Make sure you research for a maximum of 2 weeks period. When you shop for a long time, you might lose out on the <a href=\"/personal-loan.html\" title=\"Best Personal Loan Offers\">best offers on personal loans</a>.</li><li><strong>Make a down payment:</strong> Please remember it is advisable to make high down payment. Making high down payment is sure to get a better interest rate on your loan. Anything more than 30% of your personal loan amount is a good down payment and will affect the interest rate positively.</li><li><strong>Debt-to-income ratio:</strong> Debt-to-income ratio is the ratio of your total debt and you're the sum total of your income. If you have a right debt to income ratio in your portfolio, banks will be willing to offer you a low interest rate on your personal loans.</li><li><strong>Tenure of your personal loan:</strong> The tenure you choose while availing a personal loan affects the interest rate you get. The longer your loan term, the higher your interest rate. Please choose a short tenure period even if it increases your EMI amount.</li></ul>"

We are not saying using them would cut your flight expenses by half, but using them wisely would definitely reduce your expenses making your air travel economical.</p><p>Let us look at various ways to use your credit card to cut down your air travel expenses.</p><p><strong>Choose right credit card: </strong>There are a variety of credit cards available in the market that would serve your specific needs. One such card is the Airline credit card which comes with a lot of benefits for those who fly often.</p><p>Credit card issuers compete hard to attract customers and to earn business by offering various sign-up bonuses. Choosing an Airline credit card that comes up with good sign-up bonuses would reward the customer with free air miles, discounted flight tickets and many more.</p><p><strong>Accumulate more air miles: </strong>Just like how regular credit cards help you gain reward points every time you shop using a credit card, the Airline credit card offers the same benefit, but the reward points accumulated here are termed as air miles. The more you spend on your Airline credit card, the more air miles you accumulate.</p><p>Once you've gained enough miles, you can redeem them while booking your flight tickets or hotel rooms.</p><p><strong>Sign up for frequent flyer memberships: </strong>Most airlines offer frequent flyer memberships, which would help the members to earn more air miles every time they fly. You can sign up for one or more airlines' frequent flyer membership programme, as it is completely free of cost, to avail the benefits. Some memberships allow you to earn miles on one airline and redeem them on any other airline. Hence, signing up for more than one membership will help you earn more air miles every time you fly.</p><p><strong>Make use of airline promotions: </strong>Promotional offers by airlines are again a way to attract customers and to earn business in the most competitive airline space. You can take advantage of such promotional offers to make your air travel cheaper.</p><p>Some promotional programmes which offer air miles at affordable rates are the ones to grab as buying air miles at the original price is often expensive. Keep an eye on various promotional programmes offered by the airlines to make most out of it.</p><p><strong>Earn from the airline partners: </strong>Airlines partner with other retailers such as food and beverage companies, apparels, hotels and many more. Knowing your airline partners and shopping from them will also bring you reward points. However, you need to be a member of the airline's frequent flyer programme to earn the rewards from its partners.</p><p>Now that you know how to make most of your credit card, get ready to fulfil your dream of flying high within your budget. <u><strong>Read more about</strong></u></p>"

With changing lifestyles and preferences, credit card issuers are adding more and more privileges to offer credit cards with comprehensive lifestyle benefits.</p><p>A detailed look at the kind of benefits offered by lifestyle credit cards would help you understand the cards better.</p><p><strong>Travel savings</strong>: With travel becoming an essential part of modern day life, a lifestyle credit card would certainly include a benefit related to travel. It could be in the form of offering complimentary air miles, discounts on air tickets booking, hotel booking, membership to frequent flyer programmes, etc. You will also be allowed to <a href=\"/credit-card-reward-points.html\">redeem reward points</a> for plane tickets, hotel bookings, etc.</p><p><strong>Dining privileges</strong>: Dining out has become an integral part of our lifestyle. People will be eagerly waiting for the weekends to explore new dining destinations every week. To provide exclusive benefit to all such foodies, lifestyle credit cards would certainly offer privileges on dining spends including discounts at partner restaurants across India, cashback at certain restaurants, complimentary dishes, chance to become a chef and lot more.</p><p><strong>Airport lounge access</strong>: As part of the travel benefit, lifestyle credit cards also offer complimentary access to airport lounges at both domestic and international airports located across India. Cardholders can also get complimentary membership to various priority pass programmes that in turn provide exclusive lounge visits, benefits to add-on cardholders.</p><p><strong>Health and wellness benefits</strong>: As health and wellness play a key role in our day-to-day life, a few lifestyle credit cards do provide related benefits by partnering with healthcare and wellness professionals.</p><p><strong>Concierge services</strong>: Vacation in a foreign land is not as easy as it is in our own country. Unless, everything is booked and planned, we cannot make memories out of the trip. With lifestyle credit cards offering exclusive concierge services, all your booking needs will be taken care, while you enjoy your vacation. Some of the services included in concierge service are dining referral and reservation, gift delivery assistance, car rental referral and assistance, hotel referral and booking assistance, and other business services.</p><p><strong>Savings on fuel spends</strong>: One compulsory expense most of us have on a weekly basis is fuel purchase. Due to the fuel surcharge levied on card transactions, many of us tend to make payments in cash. With lifestyle credit cards, we can avoid paying the surcharge, as it is being waived by most of the credit cards when used to make fuel transactions.</p><p><strong>Movie ticket offers</strong>: After travel, entertainment plays an important part to make us feel refreshed. To cover this aspect, lifestyle credit cards offer various discounts on movie tickets and other entertainment programmes. It could be a buy one, get one movie ticket or a special discount on ticket price, cardholders can plan their weekend movie at much lesser price.</p><p><strong>Insurance cover</strong>: One interesting aspect of lifestyle credit cards is the comprehensive insurance protection. Most cards offer coverage for air accidental death, emergency hospitalisation abroad, loss of card, loss of travel documents, loss of check-in baggage, etc.</p>"

Whether we shop purposefully or impulsively, we never stop doing it. And those SALE day offers and Black Friday sales make us even more exciting. What if we get such kind of deals throughout the year? It sounds little exaggerated, but with right kind of shopping tools we can make every purchase exciting.</p><p><strong>Cashback shopping credit cards</strong>: The name says it all. Cashback shopping credit cards will bring you back a percentage of transaction amount as cashback. The amount of cashback varies from one retailer to another. If you are loyal to one or more brands, you can search for credit cards that offer cashback on that particular brand.</p><p>Shopping credit cards with accelerated rewards: These shopping credit cards may not bring you instant luck but would surprise you with gifts and rewards. Unlike regular purchases, spends related to shopping on a few categories like apparel, accessories, cosmetics, etc., would bring you accelerated reward points which can be exchanged for gifts, discounts and other deals as offered by your bank.</p><p><strong>Shopping credit cards with discount offers:</strong> Some shopping credit cards provide a year-round discount on purchases made at particular stores, either online or offline. If you frequently shop at a particular retail store, say Shoppers Stop, LifeStyle, Trends, etc., you can choose a credit card that offers discounts on spends related to that stores.</p><p>Besides the above-listed features, shopping credit cards offer complimentary gift vouchers, e-vouchers, annual fee reversal, and other exciting offers related to shopping.</p>"

These include the joining fee, the renewal (annual) fee, etc.</p><p><strong>Eligibility criteria:</strong></p><ul><li>In addition to the other criteria, to be eligible for the premium credit cards, you need to have a relatively high annual income which is above Rs.50,000 for most such cards.</li><li>On the other hand, there are regular cards which have an income criterion of as low as Rs.12,000 per month.</li></ul><p><strong>Joining bonus:</strong></p><ul><li>Most premium cards offer attractive joining bonus offers like reward points in bulk, complimentary air tickets, air miles, etc.</li><li>The regular credit cards either don't offer any joining bonus and even if some of them do, it's not very rewarding.</li></ul><p><strong>Reward points:</strong></p><ul><li>One primary advantage of premium cards is the privilege of a highly beneficial reward points program.

Higher your income, better are your chances of availing a car loan from Axis Bank.</li><li><strong>Market fluctuation: </strong>Fluctuation in market also determines the <a href=\"/car-loan-interest-rate.html\">interest rate</a> that will be charged on your loan amount. The rate of interest may be higher if the inflation is high, and similarly can be lower if the inflation rate is lower. Hence, always check how the market is performing before availing a car loan.</li><li><strong>Loan amount: </strong>The loan amount will determine the rate of interest levied. Higher the loan amount, higher will be the rate of interest.</li><li><strong>Repayment tenure: </strong>The repayment tenure plays a role in the lender determining the rate of interest charged on the loan amount. Higher the repayment tenure, higher will be the interest rate charged and vice versa.</li><li><strong>Income-to-debt ratio: </strong>The lender checks the income-to-debt ratio before deciding whether they should approve your car loan or not. The income-to-debt ratio is nothing but the ratio of your income to the debt you own. Hence, in order to avail a car loan at a lower interest rate, you must ensure that your income-to-debt ratio is low.</li><li><strong>Relationship with your bank: </strong>Your relationship with the lender will also determine the rate of interest levied on the loan amount. It is always recommended that the applicant avails a car loan from the bank where he/she holds a bank account. The bank finds it easier to provide loan to a person who has been a customer of the bank for a very long time. Hence, there is a very good chance that the applicant will get a <a href=\"/car-loan.html\">car loan</a> at a lower interest rate.</li></ul>"

This is because a higher income indicates higher repayment capacity. To be eligible for HDFC Bank car loan, your yearly income should be at least Rs.3 lakh.</li><li>Loan amount - Your eligibility for a car loan from HDFC will be higher if you apply for a lower loan amount simply because if the loan amount is lower, the bank knows that the loan will be paid off quicker. Hence, they will be more confident to lend to you.</li><li>Repayment tenure - Choosing a longer repayment tenure can lower your eligibility for a car loan as it might give an impression to the bank that your ability to pay the loan is lower. This is because longer repayment tenure results in lower EMIs and the lender may tend to think that you cannot afford to pay higher EMIs. Therefore, the bank may be reluctant to lend to you.</li><li>Credit score - This is an important factor that most banks, including HDFC Bank, consider when determining your eligibility for a car loan. A credit score of 750 and above is considered a healthy credit score by most lenders. If you have a healthy credit score, banks will be happy to offer you a car loan and hence, your eligibility will be higher.</li><li>Relationship with the bank - As stated earlier, HDFC Bank offers instant car loans to their existing customers through the ZipDrive feature. This feature allows HDFC Bank customers to can avail loans instantly, at their convenience, with negligible documentation. This indicates that your relationship with the bank is an important factor while determining your eligibility.</li></ul><a class=\"pull-right\"><img title=\"Apply for HDFC Car Loan\" alt=\"Appy for HDFC Car Loan\" src=\"/images/india/infographic/HDFC_Bank_Thumbnail_12_28_17.png\"/></a>"

This is an indication of your higher repayment capacity which will lead to banks feeling confident to lend to you. So, if you wish to boost your eligibility for a car loan, opt for a shorter repayment tenure.</li><li>Keep your credit score in check - If you wish to increase your eligibility for HDFC Bank car loan, make sure that you maintain a credit score of over 750. You can use the Free Credit Score tool to check and maintain a healthy credit score. Checking your credit score regularly can let you take corrective measures to improve it if your score is low or give you confidence to approach the bank is it is high.</li><li>Maintain a low debt-to-income ratio - A low debt-to-income ratio means that you have a good balance between your earnings and spends. Before banks lend to you, they will check how much percentage of your earnings goes in paying your debts and a low debt-to-income ratio will be an indication of your high repayment capacity. To enhance your eligibility for a car loan, you should ensure that you maintain a low debt-to-income ratio.</li><li>Apply for a loan for a lower amount - By applying for a loan for a lower amount, you can increase your eligibility for HDFC Bank car loan. A lower loan amount means that the loan will be repaid sooner and hence, the chances of you being eligible for a loan is higher.</li></ul>"

Having a credit score of 750 and above will provide the lender with an impression that the individual will be able to pay the loan amount on time.</li><li><strong>Availing a lower loan amount:</strong> Banks and other lenders usually approve the loan in case the loan amount is low. Apart from banks being comfortable in providing the loan, the <a href=\"/car-loan-interest-rate.html\">car loan interest rate</a>, that will be levied is also low.</li><li><strong>Shorter duration:</strong> Individuals who choose a shorter repayment tenure can avail the loan at lower interest rates. Therefore, it is recommended that individuals opt for shorter tenure when opting for a car loan. The chances of getting the loan approved also increases since individuals will have to pay to close the loan quicker.</li><li><strong>Low debt-to-income ratio:</strong> Before approving the car loan, banks check the individual's debt-to-income ratio.

In addition, accessories are also financed under the loan scheme.</p><p><strong>Low interest rates</strong></p><p>The car loan interest rate of the bank is one of the lowest in the market. The interest percentage is linked to MCLR, which is revised every time there is a change in the rates of RBI rate. The ongoing MCLR for one year is 8.65% while the constant rate of interest is 0.65% for cars under Rs.50 lakh and 1.15% for cars that cost above as on 22 March 2018.</p><p>Corporation Bank also waives the constant component of the interest rate for government employees and defence personnel who are looking to buy a personal vehicle below Rs.50 lakh.

                        "body": "<p>Purchasing a car is a big investment. Therefore, it is advisable to make an informed decision about your auto financing options. Here are some important factors that you should take into account when taking a car loan to purchase a car of your choice:</p><ul><li>Rate of interest on car loan: The interest rate on a car loan depends on the loan amount, loan tenure, and the eligibility of the applicant. Yes Bank offers car loans at attractive interest rates depending on your eligibility and the loan amount and loan tenure that you choose.</li><li>Documentation for car loan application: To process car loan application, banks require identity, age, income, and address proofs from the applicant. Applying for a car loan is a simple process but the documentation process could be a hassle for customers. Which is why, lenders compete with each other to attract and retain customers by offering speedy documentation. Some banks offer minimal documentation for existing customers as they already have the KYC details of the applicant. Other than easy documentation, two other things to look out for in a car loan lender are fast processing and instant approval.</li><li>Car loan eligibility: Before applying for a car loan, check whether you meet the eligibility criteria set by the bank. Car loan eligibility criteria vary from lender to lender. Some banks have a free online car loan eligibility calculator on their website to help applicants calculate their car loan eligibility. Any salaried or self-employed applicant aged between 21 and 58 years with a good credit score, a stable occupation, and a steady income is eligible for a Yes Bank car loan. Credit score of an individual represents his or her creditworthiness while the income of a person represents his or her loan repayment capacity.</li><li>Car loan fees and charges: Banks levy service fees and charges on car loans such as processing fee, foreclosure fee, prepayment fee, stamp duty charges, late payment fee, etc. Processing fee is a small percentage of the principal amount that is deducted from the loan amount at the time of loan disbursal. Prepayment charge is a small percentage of the prepayment amount wherein the percentage varies depending on the time period during the loan tenure at which the loan is partly or wholly prepaid. Late payment charges are imposed on borrowers who fail to make EMI payments on the due date. The penalty fee for a late payment is a small percentage of the outstanding due of the loan amount. Foreclosure charge is a small percentage of the outstanding loan amount that a borrower decides to fully prepay before the end of the loan tenure.</li><li>Down payment: At Yes Bank, you can avail up to 90% of the car value. Therefore, for the remaining amount of the car price, you will have to make a down payment out of your pocket. Applicants without a good credit score or who don't meet the car loan eligibility criteria can obtain an auto loan by making a higher down payment on a car of their choice. Making a high down payment can reduce the cost of your car loan on the whole.</li><li><strong><a href=\"/car-loan-emi-calculator.html\">Car Loan EMI: </a></strong>Finding out how much your car loan will cost you on a monthly basis can help you choose an affordable loan amount and a suitable loan tenure. It is advisable to maintain a low debt-to-income ratio wherein the EMI does not exceed more than 50% of the borrower's income. A high debt-to-income ratio can lead to defaulting on your car loan. Use the free online car loan EMI calculator available on the bank website or a reliable third-party website to get instant and accurate results. Car loan parameters such as loan amount, loan tenure, and interest rate are required to calculate car loan EMI.</li></ul><p>Yes Bank Car Loan Service Charges and Fees</p><table><thead><tr><th>Charges</th><th>Amount</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Part prepayment Charges</td><td>Part prepayment is allowed only after 12 EMI payments.

That is right. Below we give you a list of things that you can do which will help you fetch the best interest rates on car loans.</p><ul><li><strong>Compare the benefits -</strong> Before you pick a particular lender to avail a car loan, ensure that you explore the benefits offered by various lenders on their car loans. Once you have done that, compare the benefits and pick a lender that offers the <strong><a href=\"/car-loan-interest-rate.html\">lowest interest rates</a></strong>. Many banks offer lower interest rates to its existing customers and hence, it is a good idea to check the interest rates offered on car loans by the bank where you hold an account. Some banks may also offer lower interest rates to new customers as part of a promotion and that is why, you should always shop around before picking a lender.</li><li><strong>Choose a shorter repayment tenure -</strong> Many car loan applicants make the mistake of choosing longer repayment tenures as the EMI amount is lower on them. However, opting for a longer repayment tenure may prompt lenders to increase the interest rates on the car loan because it gives an impression of the applicant having a low repayment capacity. Therefore, if you wish to negotiate with your lender for a lower interest rate, choose a shorter repayment tenure.</li><li><strong>Ensure that you have a good credit score -</strong> If you have a credit score of more than 750, your chances of securing a loan is higher. There are some lenders that will offer you a car loan even if your credit score is low but will charge a high interest rate. It is recommended that you check your credit scores regularly and for free on the BankBazaar website under the 'Free Credit Score' section. Once you know your credit score and if it is above 750, you can confidently approach and negotiate with the lenders to offer you a car loan at low interest rates.</li><li><strong>Maintain a low debt-to-income ratio -</strong> Lenders consider the debt-to-income ratio of the applicant along with the employment status. Whether the applicant is salaried or self-employed, they should have a steady income and a low debt-to-income ratio to avail a car loan at a lower interest rate. The debt-to-income ratio is a measure of the percentage of the applicant's income spent on repayment of loans.</li></ul>"

The <a href=\"/sbi-car-loan-interest-rates.html\">SBI Car Loan interest rate</a> that you are eligible for will be dependent on various factors, some of which have been mentioned below:</p><ol><li><strong>Income-to-Debt Ratio </strong>– This is one of the primary factors that lenders take into consideration while determining the rate of interest. It basically is an indicator of the amount of money you owe to different entities. It is always recommended to have a low income-to-debt ratio as it denotes your capacity to make EMI payments on a monthly basis, without any delays.</li><li><strong>Market Fluctuations -</strong> Interest rates tend to change along with the performance of the market. Inflation also plays a major part in determining the interest rates. If the inflation rate goes up, then rates might increase and if the inflation rate goes down, then car loan interest rates might decrease. Other market conditions might also affect interest rates offered by the lender from time to time. Hence, customers should be completely aware of the prevailing market conditions when they opt for a car loan.</li><li><strong>Vehicle's Age</strong> – When you borrow a car loan, the vehicle being financed basically acts as a collateral for the entire tenure of the loan. In case you default on the payment of the EMI, the bank can hold onto your vehicle, in order to balance out the outstanding dues. This is the reason why lenders and banks take into consideration the model and age of the vehicle while determining the rate of interest.</li><li><strong>Applicant's income and occupation</strong> – In addition to the credit score of the applicant, his/her income and occupation type are also taken into consideration while determining the rate of interest. Banks typically prefer applicants that have a steady source of income as it indicates their capacity to make repayments without defaults.</li><li><strong>Repayment tenure: </strong>The repayment tenure that is the time given to the applicant to repay their loan amount will also determine the interest rate levied on their loan amount. Longer the repayment tenure, higher will be the interest rate charged on the loan amount.</li><li><strong>Relationship with your bank: </strong>The applicant's relationship with the bank will also determine the rate of interest levied on the bank. It is always recommended that the applicant avails a car loan from the bank where he/she holds a bank account. The bank finds it easier to provide loan to a person who has been a customer of the bank for a very long time. Hence, there is a very good chance that the applicant will get a car loan at a lower interest rate.</li></ol><a href=\"\" title=\"SBI Car Loan\" class=\"pull-right\"><img title=\"SBI Car Loan\" alt=\"SBI Car Loan\" src=\"/images/india/infographic/SBI-Car-Loan-3.png\"/></a>"

It I always recommended that you maintain a credit score of 750 and above as it gives the lender the impression that you will be able to repay the loan on time.</li><li><strong>Shorter tenure: </strong>It is always recommended that you go for a shorter tenure while availing a car loan. Shorter tenure also means that a lower interest rate will be levied on the loan amount. The chances of your loan getting approved is higher if you go for a shorter repayment tenure as it means that you will have to pay back the loan amount quicker.</li><li><strong>Apply for a lower loan amount: </strong>It is easier for a bank to approve your loan if your loan amount is low. This means that not only will a lower rate of interest be charged on the loan amount but since the loan amount is low, the bank finds it comfortable allowing you to avail the car loan.</li><li><strong>Maintain a low debt-to-income ratio: </strong>The bank checks debt to income ratio before allowing to avail a car loan. If there is a significant balance between your income and your expenses, then the chances of you availing a car loan at a lower interest rate increase.</li></ul>"

If you wish to avail car loans with lowest interest rates in Mumbai, you can follow the below-given tips:</p><ul><li><strong>Opt for a shorter repayment tenure –</strong> Many car loan applicants have this notion that longer repayment tenures are better as the EMI (equated monthly installment) amount payable each month is low. They fail to realize that longer repayment tenures are seen by the lenders as applicant's low repayment capacity and hence, they charge higher interest rates on them. So, if you wish to enjoy <strong><a href=\"/car-loan-interest-rate.html\">lower interest rates on a car loan</a></strong>, choose a shorter repayment tenure.</li><li><strong>Explore and compare benefits offered by various lenders – </strong>If you wish to land a good deal on interest rates, it is essential for you to explore and compare the benefits offered by various car loan lenders. Doing so will help you understand which lenders are offering the best interest rates and in turn, help you decide on one lender.</li><li><strong>Keep your debt-to-income ratio low –</strong> Debt-to-income ratio is a measure of the percentage of income the applicant spends on repaying loans and lenders consider this factor an important one while offering interest rates. If your debt-to-income ratio is lower, the chances of you securing a car loan at a lower interest rate are higher.</li><li><strong>Maintain a healthy credit score –</strong> If you have a healthy credit score, lenders will be happy to offer you a car loan at lower interest rates. A credit score of over 750 is considered a healthy score by lenders. Many lenders will offer car loans even to those with a low credit score but they will charge a higher rate of interest. To ensure that you have a healthy credit score, check your credit scores at regular intervals by using the 'Free Credit Score' tool on BankBazaar. Doing this will help you take corrective steps to improve your credit score in case it is low and if you have a good credit score, it will let you approach the lenders with confidence.</li></ul>"

                        "body": "<p>The <a href=\"/car-loan-interest-rate.html\">interest rates</a> for car loans vary among lenders in the market. Since car loans are secured through the hypothecation value of the vehicle, the interest rates for car loans are typically lower than that of personal loan interest rates. When you search for car loans, you can check out the interest rates offered by different lenders in the market before choosing one. By comparing the interest rates, you can choose the best loan product suitable for you. Some of the additional ways in which you could get the lowest possible interest rates are listed as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Loan aggregators:</strong> You can use sites like BankBazaar to compare and apply for car loans in the market. Here, you can check out the loan products offered by multiple lenders simultaneously and compare their features. You can also apply for loans instantly and keep track of your applications.</li><li><strong>Credit score:</strong> Individuals with a good credit score can get car loans at low interest rates. Since the risk of default is low, lenders provide loans at a discount rate. Most lenders in the market look for customers who have a CIBIL score of at least 750.</li><li><strong>Employment status:</strong> Your employment status indicates your ability to repay your loans on time. If you are a salaried individual, your regular monthly income indicates that you can repay your loan on time without any delay. Even self-employed individuals can get car loans by showing a steady income from their businesses.</li><li><strong>Debt-to-income ratio:</strong> This is another important factor considered by a lender in addition to your employment status. This is a measure that indicates how much percentage of your income is spent on repaying loans. The lower the debt-to-income ratio, the higher the chance of getting a car loan at a low interest rate.</li><li><strong>Tenure:</strong> Many lenders in the market also set interest rates for customers based on the loan tenure they have chosen. The higher the loan tenure, the lower the interest rate charged by the bank. However, you might end up paying more amount in overall <a href=\"/car-loan-emi-calculator.html\">EMI</a> installments. You must take this into consideration while choosing the repayment tenure for your car loan.</li><li><strong>Negotiation:</strong> Though most lenders in the market advertise fixed interest rates for car loans, you could bring down your interest rate by a little through negotiation. You must talk with the bank officials to negotiate a better interest rate. You could use the above-mentioned factors in your negotiation to argue your case.</li></ul>"

These lenders have their own ways of fixing <strong><a href=\"/car-loan-interest-rate.html\">interest rates for car loans.</a></strong> Some lenders have a fixed interest rate for all categories of customers, whereas some lenders determine set interest rates based on the borrower's credit score, loan amount, annual income, etc. Hence, it is better to compare the interest rates of different lenders before deciding on a specific loan product. If you are wondering about how to get the best possible interest rates from a lender, you can check out the following tips before approaching a lender:</p><ul><li><strong>Credit score:</strong> Most of the top lenders check your credit score before approving your loan request. This is to make sure that the risk of defaulting is minimised. Before you approach a lender for a car loan, it is better to improve your credit score. It is better to have a CIBIL score of at least 750 in order to get a competitive interest rate on your car loan.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Loan aggregators:</strong> When you use the services of loan aggregators like BankBazaar, it is possible to find car loans with the lowest possible interest rates. It is possible to compare the lending rates of multiple banks instantly and choose the best one right away. You may also use these sites to apply for loans and keep track of your applications.</li><li><strong>Job stability:</strong> This is one of the notable features considered by lenders before approving a loan application. The criteria outlined by lenders may vary from each other. Most lenders require at least one year of job stability from the applicant before approving a car loan.</li><li><strong>Income level:</strong> The income of the applicant also plays a major role in determining the interest rate charged for a car loan. Individuals with a high income are considered to be at low risk of defaulting. Hence, many lenders offer them car loans with a low interest rate.</li><li><strong>Debt-to-income ratio:</strong> This is another notable factor associated with the income of the applicant. It provides information about how much percentage of your income is spent on loan repayment. The lower you spend on other loan repayments, the higher the chance of getting a good interest rate.</li><li><strong>Loan tenure:</strong> Some lenders also consider your preferred loan tenure before setting the interest rates. Longer loan tenure fetches more income for the lender. Hence, they charge a lower interest rate for people choosing longer repayment tenures. Though choosing a longer tenure could bring down your interest rate, you might end up paying more in overall EMIs.</li><li><strong>Negotiation:</strong> Though most lenders have a fixed interest rate for car loans, you could still negotiate with the bank official to bring down the interest rate by a little. You might have better luck with negotiation if you do it in the same bank where you have your salary or business account.</li></ul>"

Getting the lowest possible interest rate is a priority for most loan applicants. However, you must also focus on other factors like additional charges, service quality, loan tenure, etc., before choosing a lender. Though the other factors are important, interest rates still play a major role in bringing down the overall cost of car loans. The tips listed here can help you find car loans at a reasonable interest rate:</p><ul><li><strong>Credit score:</strong> Credit score is one of the most important factors considered by lenders while taking a loan. Even if the loans are secured, the credit score of the applicant is still an important factor to determine the risk associated with a loan. Lenders prefer individuals with a credit score of 750 and above. If you have a good credit score, you can easily find the best loan products at reasonable interest rates.</li><li><strong>Steady income:</strong> All the top lenders in the market provide loans to their customers only after verifying their income. This applies to both salaried and self-employed individuals. Salaried applicants must be employed in their current job for at least one year. According to lenders, borrowers with a steady income are at low risks of defaults.</li><li><strong>Debt-to-income ratio:</strong> This refers to the percentage of monthly income spent on paying EMIs. If this is significantly high, the risk of default is high for the lender. This is the reason why lenders offer <strong><a href=\"/car-loan-interest-rate.html\">low interest rates</a></strong> for people with a low debt-to-income ratio.</li><li><strong>Income level:</strong> Most banks offer interest rate discounts for people with high monthly income. High-income earners typically have a great loan repayment potential. Hence, it is possible for these individuals to get loans at competitive interest rates.</li><li><strong>Loan tenure:</strong> There are many lenders in the market who consider the loan tenure chosen by the borrower while determining the interest rates. This criterion varies among the lenders in the market. Some lenders offer low interest rates for high loan tenure. However, you need to choose your options carefully while applying for such loans as there is a chance of paying more in overall EMIs.</li><li><strong>Vehicle model:</strong> If there is a default, banks have to recover the vehicle to get back their loan amount. Hence, they consider the vehicle model before setting interest rates for a borrower. Vehicles from a reputed manufacturer have a higher resale value, and lenders charge a lower interest rate for these models.</li></ul>"

                        "body": "<p>The interest rate you get in one city may not be the same as the ones you get in other cities. In any case, when you're applying for an automobile loan in Ahmedabad, you need to make sure that you apply for one that charges you a lower rate of interest.</p><p>The interest rate that your lender charges you depends on a few factors. Let's take a look at what these are. Based on this, we're giving you a few tips on how you can get better interest rates for your vehicle loan.</p><ul><li><strong>Your income level:</strong> How much you earn every month helps lenders get an idea of how much you will be able to repay. While most lenders require you to have a minimum income, having a higher income can help you get better interest rates and loan conditions. Usually, the more you earn, the <strong><a href=\"/car-loan-interest-rate.html\">lower the interest rate</a></strong> you get. Also, a higher level of income indicates that you will not have any trouble with repaying what you borrow, meaning, the lender bears lesser risk.</li><li><strong>Current debt scenario:</strong> How much debt you currently are in makes a difference to the interest rate you get. Your debt-to-income ratio shows lenders how much of your current monthly income goes towards repaying loans that you have already taken. If this ratio is high, it means that you may not be able to manage paying another loan, i.e. your car loan, in this case. Or you may be given high interest rates. So, if your debt-to-income ratio is high, work on lowering it first.</li><li><strong>Your credit score matters:</strong> Your credit score plays an important role in determining your eligibility for a vehicle loan. It is an indication of how you have been handling your loans and credit card bills, how much credit you have been utilising, etc. till now. If you've been wise and prudent with your finances, you should have a good score. A good credit rating can help you get good interest rates. So, if you want to get better rates and loan terms, work on improving your credit score first.</li><li><strong>Pay a larger down payment:</strong> The down payment is the amount of money you have to bring in on your own. The lender will provide the rest. If you pay a considerable sum as a down payment (say about 30% of the value of the car), the lender may give you a lower rate of interest. But do keep in mind that if this is going to eat into your savings, it's better not to blow all of it on the down payment.</li><li><strong>Choose your tenure wisely:</strong> Your tenure is an important part of your EMI. It determines how long your loan will go on for. A longer tenure results in lower interest rates and lower monthly repayments. But it also means that you will be paying a larger amount of interest in the long run. It also keeps you in debt for a long time. You should choose a tenure that keeps your interest payments and EMIs at an affordable level.</li><li><strong>Visit loan aggregators:</strong> An online loan aggregator is a good way to find the loan you want within a few minutes. Instead of spending hours or days finding out various loan options from all the lenders out there, you can get it done quickly through a loan aggregator. By providing some of your basic details such as your monthly income and area of residence, you will get an entire list of all the auto loans you're eligible for. This way you can easily find out what the cheapest options in Ahmedabad are.</li><li><strong>Negotiation is important:</strong> Sometimes negotiating with your lender can get you results like nothing else can. In order to do this well, you need to present your fact well. For example, if you're expecting a raise in your income in the coming months, tell this to the bank. If they consider this while processing your application, it may help you get a lower rate of interest.</li></ul>"

Although taking a car loan reduces the financial burden on the buyer significantly, it is necessary to borrow a car loan at a low interest rate to keep the total cost of the loan low. If you pay a high annual interest on your loan, the overall repayment amount will shoot up, and vice versa. Here are a few things that you should keep in mind if you are looking to borrow a car loan at a reasonable rate of interest:</p><ul><li><strong>Check Your Credit Score:</strong> Your credit score indicates your repayment ability to your lender. Banks and financial institutions check your credit score before approving a loan to gauge your creditworthiness. Thus, if you have a low credit score, the lender may reject your car loan application. For this reason, it is advisable to check your credit score before you apply for a car loan. When taking a loan, it is best to maintain a credit score over 750. Having a high credit score will help you borrow the loan at a lower rate of interest with better repayment options.</li><li><strong>Do Your Research:</strong> It is in your best interest to <a href=\"/car-loan-interest-rate.html\">compare the interest rates</a> and other terms and conditions of car loans offered by different lenders before applying to a particular lender for a loan. You can compare the terms and conditions of various car loans by either visiting the official websites of banks and financial institutions or through a trusted third-party financial services website like BankBazaar.</li><li><strong>Make a Down Payment:</strong> If you are willing to make a large down payment, the amount that you will have to borrow from the lender will reduce, thus also reducing the total interest that you will be paying to the lender over the course of the loan tenure.</li><li><strong>Negotiate with Your Lender:</strong> If you have a good relationship with the lender or have a high credit score, you can try negotiating with the lender for a better interest rate. Banks and financial institutions are more likely to offer you an affordable interest rate if you have a good repayment history.</li><li><strong>Read the Fine Print:</strong> Although the interest rate that is charged by a lender will significantly impact the cost of the loan, you should also ensure that you read through the terms and conditions of the loan and are well versed with the various charges that may be levied by the lender. Your lender may charge you a high processing fee, documentation fee, pre-payment penalty, default penalty, etc., which could adversely affect the cost of your loan, even though you may be charged a low interest rate. Therefore, you should ensure that you take all the charges levied by the lender and the features and benefits of the loan into account when deciding which lender to apply to.</li></ul>"

If your score is lower than that, the chances of your car loan application getting rejected are higher. Hence, before you apply for a car loan, it is advised that you check your credit score.

So, it is never a good idea to miss out paying your EMIs. Also, if you miss out on your car loan EMI for more than 6 months, the lender can seize your vehicle and auction it to recover the outstanding loan amount since your vehicle is hypothecated with the lender.</p>"

Choosing a shorter repayment tenure will also help you save on the interest that you would have paid if you chose a longer tenure.</li><li><strong>Maintain a high credit score – </strong>Lenders look for a credit score of at least 750 to offer you a car loan as a credit score is an indication of your repayment capacity. Your chances of getting a car loan at a lower interest rate are higher if your credit score is over 800 because the chances of you defaulting on the loan are lower as indicated by your score.</li><li><strong>Keep your debt-to-income ratio low – </strong>Having a low debt-to-income ratio gives an impression to the lender that despite your debt obligations, you are capable of paying the EMI for your car loan.

To maintain a healthy credit score, you should pay all your debts on time and <a href=\"/credit-score.html?variant=slide&utm_source=bb&utm_medium=display&utm_campaign=GATEWAY_BANNER&ck=Y%2BziX71XnZjIM9ZwEflsyAwU7nH9yhDPZKPICnKAvRxAevB1eS8eCGuBkX8I0T6I\">check your credit score</a> regularly.</li><li><strong>Maintain a low debt-to-income ratio – </strong>Your debt-to-income ratio is a percentage of your gross monthly income that goes in paying your monthly debts.

Through the help of this information, he can choose the right loan for himself and enjoy a very good deal.</p><p>Why is it important to calculate car loan EMI before applying for one?</p><p>As you know, car loans like any other other loan are repaid by the borrower in Equated Monthly Installments (EMIs) to the lender (bank) over the loan tenure. The principal and interest amount that the borrower has to pay each month make up the car loan EMI. Before applying for a car loan, take the time to calculate the EMI of your proposed car loan in order to find out how much the loan will cost you on a monthly basis. Based on the EMI, you can create a monthly budget and ensure your EMI doesn't exceed your income. This is called the low debt-to-income ratio. This way, there are fewer chances of you defaulting on your car loan.</p><p>Car loan EMI is calculated using the below formula:</p><p>E = P x r x (1+r)^n/((1+r)^n -1)) where, EMI is the Equated Monthly Installment, P is the principal loan amount, r is the interest rate per month, and n is the loan tenure in months.</p><p>To save time and money, you can use the United Bank of India Car Loan EMI Calculator. It is a free and easy-to-use online tool. Just enter the proposed car loan details like loan tenure, interest rate, and loan amount into the tool and click on the 'calculate' button. You will get a breakdown of the principal amount, interest, EMI, and the outstanding due after each EMI payment. The car loan EMI calculator can be used to pick a loan amount that you can afford to repay and a suitable loan tenure to save on interest payments.</p><p>How to apply for a United Bank of India car loan?</p><p>Download the United Bank of India car loan application form from the bank website or get it from the nearest bank branch. Submit the duly-filled and signed application form online or at a UBI branch along with the necessary document proofs.Use the 'Branch Locator' tool on the bank website in order to locate a UBI branch near you.

In case your credit score is bad, your application will either be rejected, or lenders will provide car loans at high interest rates. A good credit score also shows that you are financially stable. Therefore, lenders offer a low interest rate if your credit score is good.</li><li><strong>Opt for a short tenure: </strong>The longer the repayment tenure, the higher the interest rate is. Therefore, in case you want to reduce the interest rates, you must opt for a shorter tenure. Even though the Equated Monthly Instalments <a href=\"car-loan-emi-calculator.html\">(EMIs)</a> will be low for a long repayment tenure, the interest rates are high.</li><li><strong>Compare:</strong> It is important that you compare car loans that are offered by various banks and NBFCs before opting for one. Certain banks and NBFCs offer car loans at lower interest rates when compared to others. There are various third-party websites, such as Bankbazaar.com, where car loans from different lenders can be compared. The benefits and features of these car loans can also be compared.</li><li><strong>Negotiate with the lender: </strong>You can also try to negotiate with the lender when availing a car loan. Based on various factors such as loan tenure, income status, and credit score, the interest rate can be negotiated. Before you approach any lenders, negotiate with your existing bank, as they may offer you a car loan with a lower interest rate.</li><li><strong>Maintain a low debt-to-income ratio:</strong> All lenders will assess your debt-to-income ratio before providing a car loan. In case you have any existing EMIs, it is better that you clear them before opting for a car loan. In case you have a high debt-to-income ratio, the interest rates will be high.</li></ul>"

                        "body": "<p>Apart from comparing the car loans offered by different banks, there are other ways to the fetch the lowest interest rates in Vijayawada:</p><ol><li><strong>Maintain a high credit score</strong></li><p>Several banks including SBI, Canara Bank, and Bank of India offer the best rates to applicants who maintain high credit scores. A credit score of 750 and above is considered a high score. Highest interest rates are offered to applicants with lowest credit scores, followed by those with no credit history.</p><li><strong>New car loan come with lower interest rates</strong></li><p>Used car loans always have a higher interest rate compared to new car loans (as you can see from the table). Some banks such as Canara Bank and BOI offer the same rates on both loans. The margin or down payment that you have to pay is also much higher for used car loans when compared to new car loans. For a used car, the margin can go up to 40% compared to 10%-25% for new cars.</p><p>So, if you're looking to save more by applying for a used car loan, there are several factors that you need to consider, especially the high interest rates, the down payment, and the age of the car.</p><li><strong>Salaried employees get lower rates compared to self-employed</strong></li><p>Salaried employees often get get lower interest rates on not just car loans, but also other loans when compared to self-employed individuals. This is because salaried employees have a fixed income that they earn every month, thereby, posing a lower risk than self-employed applicants who earn variable income. Bank of India (BOI) is one such bank that offers lower rates to salaried customers.</p><li><strong>Lower interest rates based on Gender</strong></li><p>Some banks offer lower interest rates to female applicants compared to their male counterparts. The difference in interest rate in most cases is 0.05% p.a. Though the percentage appears negligible, the savings from interest can be significant.</p><p>For example, the interest payments alone on a Rs.5 lakh car loan for 5 years at an interest rate of 9% p.a. is around Rs.1,22,751. Keeping all other parameters constant, the interest payment at a rate of 9.50% p.a. is Rs.1,30,056. The difference in savings is Rs.7,305.</p><li><strong>Longer tenures usually come with lower interest rates</strong></li><p>If the interest on your car loan is your only consideration, then choosing a longer repayment tenure will offer you the lowest rates. There's also the added bonus of smaller EMIs (equated monthly instalments). The drawback here is that longer tenures also charge higher interest. If you're looking for interest savings rather than a low interest rate, then choose a shorter tenure. But do so only if you can afford to pay a larger EMI.</p><p>For example, the EMI for a Rs.5 lakh car loan at an interest of 9.50% p.a. for 5 years is Rs.10,501. The total interest payable is Rs.1,30,056. So essentially, you're repaying Rs.6,35,056. Now if you have the financial capacity to repay more and choose a tenure of 3 years, then your EMI will be Rs.16,061. The total interest payable will be Rs.76,593 and the overall repayment towards the loan will be Rs.5,81,593. The interest savings alone on this loan are Rs.53,463, all for choosing a shorter loan tenure. Note: A 1% processing fee is added to the calculations.</p><p>If you wish to calculate your EMIs and total interest payable on your car loan, you can use the <a href=\"/car-loan/emi-calculator.html\">BankBazaar Car Loan EMI Calculator</a>.</p></ol>"

Banks use various factors to determine the risk profile of an individual before setting the interest rate. Though car loans are secured through the value of the vehicle, lenders still consider it risky to lend money to certain individuals. Hence, interest rates are likely to be high for these individuals. If you are wondering about how you can reduce the interest rate charged for your car loan, the following tips will help you:</p><ul><li><strong>Maintain a good credit score:</strong> The credit score of an individual is based on his/her credit repayment history. Lenders use this score to assess the risk profile of a potential borrower. If you have maintained a credit score above 750, you are likely to have a good repayment history and you can get <strong><a href=\"/car-loan-interest-rate.html\">car loans with low interest rates.</a></strong> On the contrary, individuals with poor credit score will have to shell out more due to high interest rates.</li><li><strong>Have a stable employment:</strong> Most lenders look at the job stability of the borrower before approving a loan application. Job stability is a reflection of the borrower's ability to repay the loan installments on time. This is the reason why it is difficult for people without a steady income to get loans.</li><li><strong>Compare and shop around:</strong> There are plenty of banks and non-banking financial corporations operating in India. The interest rates charged by these lenders vary significantly. You need to compare the rates of different players before coming to a decision. Loan aggregators like BankBazaar can help you in comparing the interest rates of all lenders instantly and applying for the right one.</li><li><strong>Maintain a low debt-to-income ratio:</strong> If you are already paying too much for other loans, it is not a good idea to get a new loan. Lenders check out the percentage of income you are spending on loan repayments before approving a loan. If your debt-to-income ratio is too high, lenders consider it to be of high-risk and set high interest rates.</li><li><strong>Increase your down payment:</strong> There are many lenders in the market that provide 100% financing for auto loans. However, you can get competitive interest rates by increasing your down payment share. Since you are investing a lot of money in the vehicle, lenders consider you to be at a low risk of defaulting.</li><li><strong>Negotiate with the lender:</strong> If you have already followed the above tips, you can bring down the interest rate further by negotiating with the lender. You can check a bank official about the different ways in which you can lower your interest rate.</li> </ul>"

Hence, it is not possible to get loans from more than one lender to finance the same car. There are lenders who provide 100% of the on-road price of the car. You may take loans from such lenders if you cannot pay the down payment for your vehicle.</p>"

                    "answer": "<p>If you do not meet the eligibility criteria outlined by the lender, your car loan application is likely to get rejected. Typically, car loan applications get rejected due to low credit score, inadequate income, too many existing loans, defaults on other loans, etc. You need to check the eligibility requirements before you apply for a loan with a specific lender.</p>"

Here they are:</p><ol><li><strong>Ensure that your credit score is high</strong></li><p>A number of lenders across Vadodara offer lower interest rates to customers whose credit scores are above 750. A lower credit score would mean that the interest rate offered to you could be quite high. A higher credit score, on the other hand, ensures relatively favourable terms and conditions.</p><li><strong>Lower interest rates for new car loans</strong></li><p>The interest rate offered to customers who wish to purchase second hand cars is relatively high in comparison with the interest rates offered for the purchase of new cars. Certain lenders offer the same interest rates for both new car loans as well as used car loans. The down payment or margin to be paid by the applicant is also quite high for used car loans in comparison with new car loans. The margin for used cars can be as high as 40%, while the margin for new cars can range from 10% to 25%. In case you are going in for a used car loan, you must take into consideration several factors such as the down payment, the interest rates, and the vehicle's age.</p><li><strong>Lower rates for salaried employees in comparison with self-employed individuals</strong></li><p>The interest rates offered to salaried applicants is usually lower in comparison with the interest rates offered to self-employed individuals. This applies not only to car loans but all other kind of loans. The reason for this is that salaried applicants derive a fixed income each month, thereby making the less risky in comparison with self-employed individuals whose income varies each month.</p><li><strong>Lower interest rates for women</strong></li><p>A number of banks in Vadodara offer lower interest rates on car loans to female borrowers. Although the difference between the rates offered to women and men is marginal, the amount of money that can be saved on interest is quite significant. If you are a woman seeking a car loan in Vadodara, you can find several banks and financial institutions that will offer you the amount you require for a slightly lower interest rate.</p><li><strong>Lower interest rates for longer tenures</strong></li></ol><p>If the main factor you take into consideration when applying for a car loan is the interest rate, you can go for a longer repayment tenure as the longer the tenure, the lower the interest rate. Another advantage of taking a loan with a longer repayment tenure is that the EMIs are also smaller. The issue with longer tenures, however, is that you end up paying a lot by way of interest. If you wish to save on the money you would otherwise pay as interest, a shorter tenure would work best for you, but the EMIs will be higher so make sure you can afford to make the payment each month before you sign on the dotted line.</p>"

It is better if you clear any existing Equated Monthly Instalments <a href=\"/car-loan-emi-calculator.html\">(EMIs)</a> before opting for a car loan. The car loan would be rejected or provided at high interest rates in case you have a high debt-to-income ratio.</li><li><strong>Compare:</strong> It is vital that you compare car loans provided by various lenders before choosing one. Certain lenders will provide car loans at lower interest rates when compared to others. Various third-party websites such as Bankbazaar.com can be used to compare car loans from various lenders. You will need to enter basic details before car loans can be compared. Various benefits and features of the car loan can also be compared online.</li><li><strong>Maintain a good credit score: </strong>Maintaining a good credit score is vital when you apply for a car loan. The loan application will be rejected, or the interest rates will be high in case your credit score is bad. Having a good credit score will show lenders that you are financially stable and will be able to pay the loan back on time.</li><li><strong>Negotiate with lenders:</strong> You can apply for a loan with your existing bank before applying for one from other lenders. In case you have a good relationship with the bank, they may provide a car loan with a low interest rate. You may also be able to negotiate the interest rate. The rate of interest of the car loan can be negotiated based on several factors such as the credit score, income status, and loan tenure.</li><li><strong>Choose a shorter tenure:</strong> The interest rate will be high in case you opt for a longer repayment tenure. Therefore, you can opt for a shorter tenure for low interest rates. However, the EMIs will be higher for shorter tenures.</li><li><strong>Pay a high down payment:</strong> The amount of loan that is provided will be less in case you make a high down payment. Lenders offer loans at low interest rates as well since a high down payment will provide the impression that you are financially stable.</li></ul>"

                        "body": "<p>The easiest way to get low interest rates may be to compare rates offered by different banks in Thane on third-party websites. Apart from this, there are several other ways to fetch the lowest interest rates on car loans:</p><ol><li><strong>Ensure you have a high credit score</strong></li><p>Many banks offer different rates of interest to applicants with varying credit scores. This is because your credit score is also a measure of your risk of defaulting on the loan. A high score (usually 750+) indicates a lower risk of default and a low score (below 700) indicates a higher risk.</p><p>For instance, IDBI Bank offers lowest rates to applicants with credit scores above 800. They do not offer loans to applicants with a score below 700. Similarly, Bank of Maharashtra offers lowest rate to customers with a credit score of 750 and above.</p><p>If you do not have a credit score, you will not enjoy low rates. So, it is advisable to first build credit history before applying for an auto loan.</p><li><strong>Women applicants and government employees can get lower rates</strong></li><p>If you are a woman or you work for the government, you could enjoy concessional rates on your car loan. Punjab National Bank (PNB) offers a lower rate for such applicants, also, they do not take your credit score into consideration while offering you your rate of interest. For instance, if you are married, then you could take the car loan along with your wife to enjoy lower rates.</p><li><strong>Shorter loan tenures can come with lower interest rates</strong></li><p>Some banks offer a lower interest rate on loan tenures below 5 years. For example, if you apply for an SBI car loan for a loan tenure under 5 years, you will get a concession of 0.1% on the rate. Also, if you are a woman, you will get a concession of 5 basis points if your credit score is between 600 and 649.</p><p>On the other hand, some banks could charge a higher rate on short-term loans compared to long-term ones. However, in any case, short-term loans lead to higher interest savings because you are paying interest for a shorter duration. But your equated monthly instalments (EMIs) will be higher. Long-term car loans require smaller EMIs but the interest you pay will be more.</p><p>Let's take an example here: Let's say the car loan charges 8.85% p.a. interest for a loan of Rs.5 lakh and tenure of 4 years. The interest charged will be Rs.95,533 and the EMI will be Rs.12,407. Now, keeping all other parameters constant, let's say you've taken the loan for 7 years. The interest charged will be Rs.1,72,548 and the EMI will be Rs.8,007.</p><p>You can see from the example above that a change in 3 years can lead to interest savings of Rs.77,015.</p><p>If you wish to calculate your EMIs and interest payments on your car loan, you could use the <a href=\"/car-loan/emi-calculator.html\">BankBazaar Car Loan EMI Calculator</a>.</p><li><strong>Maintain a good relationship with a bank</strong></li><p>If you have been a customer of a bank and have maintained a good relationship, you may be offered preferential rates. They may not always be advertised but you could request your bank for further details. Bank of Maharashtra, however, offers a discount of 0.25% on car loan interest rates for maintaining a minimum of 1-year relationship with the bank.</p><li><strong>Salaried employees are often offered lower rates</strong></li><p>Salaried employees have steady income coming in every month. This ensures that they can service their EMIs, making them low-risk customers of the bank. Self-employed individuals, on the other hand, pose a higher risk due to the nature of their employment, i.e. uncertainty of consistent income.</p><p>Due to this reason, some banks charge higher interest rates on car loans from self-employed individuals. Bank of Maharashtra, for example, charges 0.5% more interest from self-employed individuals. This percentage may seem insignificant now but based on the loan quantum and tenure, it can lead to significant savings.</p><p>So, if you are self-employed, you will need to do more research to find lenders who offer the same rate to both, salaried and self-employed.</p></ol>"

Apart from comparing interest rates offered by various lenders, here are other factors:</p><ol><li><strong>Salaried employees are offered lower interest rates</strong></li><p>Many banks offer <a href=\"/car-loan-interest-rate.html\">lower interest rates</a> to salaried employees. This is because they pose a lower risk to the bank in terms of defaulting on the loan as they have a consistent flow of income coming in every month. Self-employed, on the other hand have variable income, thereby, posing a larger risk of default to lenders. For example, Bank of India offers 0.1% lower rate to salaried employees.</p><li><strong>Customers with higher credit rating are offered lower interest rates</strong></li><p>Different banks have different ways of assessing risk when it comes to lending. For example, SBI assess risk by considering applicants credit scores. Applicants with credit score above 750 are offered the lowest interest rates and applicants with scores below 650 are offered the highest rates. Allahabad Bank uses customer rating to determine interest rates on car loans from AB-1 to AB-6. The closer your rating is to AB-1, the lower your interest rate on car loan will be.</p><li><strong>Women are offered lower interest rates than men</strong></li><p>Many banks are encouraging car ownership by women through offering concessional interest rates on select car loan schemes. For instance, SBI, under their Loyalty Car Loan Scheme, are currently offering women 0.05% lower interest rates than men.</p><li><strong>Existing customers of banks can enjoy preferential interest rates</strong></li><p>If you have an existing relationship with a bank, you could be offered a lower interest rate than other applicants. Bank of Baroda offer existing home loan customers a concession of 0.25% on car loan interest rates. Similarly, several banks offer a lower rate of interest to customers who maintain a salary account with them.</p><li><strong>Choose a new car loan to enjoy lower interest rates</strong></li><p>All lenders either offer lower rates or the same rate to applicants who are purchasing new cars. The difference in interest rate of new car loans and used car loans can go up to 4%, in some cases, even higher. This means higher interest payments. Although new cars are more expensive, you will pay more in interest payments on a used car loan.</p><p>Let's take an example here – the interest payments on a new car costing Rs.4 lakh, at a tenure of 3 years and interest rate of 9% p.a., will be around Rs.58,000. In comparison, the interest payments on a used car costing Rs.3 lakh, with a tenure of 3 years and interest rate of 13% p.a. will be around Rs.64,000.</p><p>As you can see, although the cost of a used car is lesser, the interest payments are higher due to the higher interest rate charged.</p><p>If you want to calculate your estimated EMIs (equated monthly instalments), interest payments, and overall cost of your car loan, you can use the <a href=\"/car-loan/emi-calculator.html\">BankBazaar Car Loan EMI Calculator</a>.</p></ol>"

If you have a score of, say 800 and above, lenders are more likely to offer you a lower interest rate as the risk associated with lending to you, is lower.</li><li><strong>Avail loan of a lower amount - </strong>You will need to avail a loan of a lesser amount if you make a higher down payment. Doing so may compel lenders to offer you a lower interest rate as they will get an impression that you are financially very sound and can repay the loan easily. Availing a lower loan amount will also lead to you paying off your loan quicker.</li><li><strong>Keep your debt-to-income ratio low – </strong>If your debt-to-income ratio is low, chances of the lender offering you a lower interest rate are higher. This is because a low debt-to-income ratio is an indication of your high repayment capacity.</li><li><strong>Negotiate with your existing lender – </strong>Your existing lender is likely to offer you a car loan with a lower interest rate if you have a good payment record with them. This will, of course, depend on other factors as well, such as your credit score, loan tenure, your income, etc. Hence, before you approach other lenders and negotiate with them for a lower interest rate, it is best you check with your existing lender first.</li><li><strong>Explore the options and compare – </strong>Perhaps, the first thing that many of us do before availing any kind of loan is to check out all the options available in the market. This is a good practice because only when you do that, you can compare the options and make an informed decision.</li></ul>"

There are various third-party websites, such as BankBazaar.com, where car loans offered by various lenders can be compared.</li><li><strong>Maintain a high credit score: </strong>Your credit score is one of the most important factors that is considered when determining the rate of interest.

This is because the risk associated with lending to you is lower and hence, may lead to the lender offering you a lower interest rate. A short repayment tenure will also save you from paying high interest over the loan tenure.</li><li><strong>Maintain a healthy credit score – </strong>A good credit score is an indication of your good repayment record and hence, if you have a credit score of around 800 and above, your chances of securing a car loan with a low interest rate are higher. However, a credit score of 750 is the minimum score that most lenders look for but the higher your score, the higher are your chances of getting a lower interest rate. To maintain a healthy score, ensure that you <a href=\"/credit-report.html\">check your credit score</a> regularly.</li><li><strong>Negotiate with your existing lender – </strong>If you have a good transaction history with your existing lender, you can negotiate with them to give you a car loan at a <a href=\"/car-loan-interest-rate.html\">lower interest rate</a>. Most times, they will be happy to acknowledge your request.</li><li><strong>Compare all car loan options – </strong>Before you decide on a lender, ensure that you have checked out all the car loan options offered by various lenders and compare them. Doing that will help you make an informed decision. If a low interest rate is what you are looking for, you can choose the lender that offers the lowest interest rate on its car loan. However, we advise you to look out for other benefits as well.</li><li><strong>Keep a low debt-to-income ratio – </strong>A debt-to-income ratio is the percentage of your gross monthly income that is spent on paying your EMIs and a low ratio indicates that you can pay your EMIs for your car loan. Lenders are likely to consider this positive and offer you a car loan with a lower interest rate.</li></ul>"

Hence, we recommend that you avail a loan only when you have assessed your affordability. Since you have already missed out on paying one EMI, we would suggest you not to miss paying any more EMIs. If you miss 6 EMI payments consecutively, the lender has the authority to seize your vehicle and auction it to recover your loan outstanding amount.</p>"

Lenders also provide car loans at a low interest rate if the down payment is high because it will give them the impression that you are financially stable.</li><li><strong>Compare:</strong> It is vital that car loans offered by various banks and NBFCs are compared before opting for one. Lower interest rates are offered on car loans by certain NBFCs and banks when compared to others. There are various third-party websites, such as Bankbazaar.com, where car loans from different lenders can be compared. The various features and benefits of the car loan can also be compared on these sites.</li><li><strong>Maintain a low debt-to-income ratio:</strong> Your debt-to-income ratio will be accessed by all lenders before they provide a car loan. It is better if you clear any existing EMIs as it will reduce your debt-to-income ratio. Lenders will provide car loans with high interest rates if your debt-to-income ratio is high.</li><li><strong>Maintain a good credit score:</strong> Your credit score is one of the main factors that determine the interest rate of the car loan. Your application will be rejected, or the rate of interest will be high in case your credit score is low.</li></ul><p>A good credit score also shows that you are financially stable.

But how can you make sure that you get the lowest rate in the market?</p><p>There are a number of factors that determine what your interest rate will be. In this section, we're going to take a deeper look into these factors and how they influence your vehicle loan's interest rate. We'll also see how you can use them to your advantage to get the best rates in the city.</p><ul><li><strong>Your credit history:</strong> Your credit score indicates how responsible you are with your finances. It shows lenders whether you have been repaying your existing loans on time and doing the same with your credit card bills as well. Having a good credit score can help you get better loan terms including lower interest rates. But if your score is not good, lenders may not give you favourable rates or may even reject your application. So, if your score is low, you should try and improve it before applying for an auto loan.</li><li><strong>Your debt-to-income ratio:</strong> This ratio compares your income to the amount of debt you currently have against your name. It shows how much of your monthly income is going towards loan EMIs. If this ratio is on the higher side, it will tell lenders that you are currently handling too many loans. This may result in your loan application being rejected or you may get a loan with high interest rates to offset the risk the lender has to bear. So, if this ratio is high for you. You should try and clear most of your debts before applying for another loan.</li><li><strong>Your monthly income:</strong> Lenders usually require you to earn a minimum income in order to qualify for a vehicle loan. But the truth is, the more you earn, the better it is for the lender because you run a lower risk of not repaying the loan. Therefore, the lender may give you lower interest rates on your loan since his risk level is low. If you're expecting a rise in your income, wait till you get the raise, and then apply. This may help you get better rates of interest.</li><li><strong>Be wise about your loan tenure:</strong> Choosing the right tenure for your loan is important especially since it can help you reduce your loan costs in the long run. Sometimes, lenders may give you a lower rate of interest if you choose a longer loan tenure. But remember that you are more likely to pay more interest in total over a longer tenure. But a longer tenure also means <a href=\"car-loan-emi-calculator.html\">lower EMIs</a>. So, choose based on which option is more beneficial to you.</li><li><strong>Make larger down payments:</strong> Making a down payment larger than usual can help reduce the rate of interest on your auto loan. But if you're planning on making a large down payment, keep an eye on your savings. You don't want to exhaust your savings and be in a position of not having enough cash if an emergency arises.</li><li><strong>Consult an online loan aggregator:</strong> An online loan aggregator can help you find the vehicle loan best suited for your needs in a matter of minutes. By giving a few details regarding your income, age, and where you stay, you will be able to find out the options available to you in Gurgaon. This should help you identify the cheapest loans being offered in the city and apply accordingly.</li><li><strong>The power of negotiation:</strong> In a country like India, you know that a little bargaining can help you get reduced prices. The same applies when you want to get loans from lenders as well, except that it's called negotiating. For example, if you want to take a loan from your existing bank but find another lender offering a lower rate, talking to your bank about this might help in reducing your interest rate.</li></ul>"

But they are also susceptible to change as and when the Marginal Cost of funds based Lending Rate (MCLR) changes. MCLR is linked to the repo rate. So, if RBI reduces the repo rate, your interest rate may also reduce. But if the repo rate increases, your interest rate will also increase. Fixed rates, on the other hand, remain constant irrespective of the market changes. Since floating rates tend to be lower, most people prefer them.</p>"

You need to convince your lender why you deserve a lower rate. This is where it helps to take a car loan from your current bank.

But if you don't pay for a long time, the lender will be at a loss and may exercise their right to confiscate your car. Defaults in loan repayment will also adversely impact your credit score.</p>"

Also, if you're earning a good salary, lenders can rest assured that you will be able to repay your loan without any defaults.</li><li><strong>The tenure of your loan:</strong> The tenure of your loan can determine the interest rate applicable to your vehicle loan. If you choose a longer loan period, your lender may offer you a <strong><a href=\"/car-loan-interest-rate.html\">lower rate of interest.</a></strong>But you also need to remember that you will end up paying more interest over a longer tenure. Also, you will remain indebted to your lender for a longer period of time. So, choose long tenure only if it is beneficial to you.</li><li><strong>Your credit score:</strong> Your credit score is an indication of how responsible you are with your money. It shows how you have handled loans in the past. A good credit score tells lenders that you are prompt in your loan repayments and credit card bill payments. This makes you a trustworthy borrower and you may stand to gain multiple benefits such as lower interest rates, better terms of the loan, etc.</li><li><strong>Current debt status:</strong> This refers to your debt-to-income ratio. This shows how many loans you have already taken and how much money you owe in comparison to how much you earn every month. If you have too many loans in your name already, lenders may think that you may not be able to repay another one as well. And they might reject your loan application or offer you a loan with a high interest rate.</li><li><strong>Down payment:</strong> Making a sizeable down payment may help you get better interest rates. For example, if you put down about 20% or more of the cost of the car as down payment, chances are the lender will give you a lower rate. But when making a large down payment, make sure it does not eat into your savings too much. This may leave you cash-strapped.</li><li><strong>Negotiate with the lender:</strong> The power of negotiation cannot be discounted. When you apply for a vehicle loan, make sure you negotiate well with the lender. If you're able to convince the lender that you will pay the instalments on time, you may be able to get a good interest rate.</li></ul>"

                        "body": "<p>The rates of interest charged on car loans vary from lender to lender. The car loan interest rates are usually low as the vehicle is hypothecated with the bank, making the loan a secured loan. There are a number of factors which are considered by the lenders at the time of deciding the interest rate for car loans. Discussed below are some tips which you can follow to make sure that you are eligible for the lowest interest rate on your car loan.</p><ul><li><strong>Credit score:</strong> Having a good credit score will earn you brownie points. The credit score is one of the first factors which is checked by the loan providers to find out the credit history and risk factor of the applicant. A higher credit score means a lower risk factor. Thus, if you have a credit score of at least 750 or more, the interest rate that will be charged for your car loan can be expected to be the lowest.</li><li><strong>Compare and apply:</strong> You should always make sure that you compare all the available options before you apply for a car loan. You can visit a third-party aggregator website such as BankBazaar. BankBazaar will list down all the lenders who are willing to offer a car loan on the basis of your eligibility. You can compare all the features, benefits, charges, and rates of interest offered by these lenders. This comparison will make it easier for you to choose the lender that suits all your requirements and serves you best.</li><li><strong>Status of employment:</strong> The loan repayment capability of the applicant is dependent on his or her employment status. The applicant will be required to have a steady and regular source of income to ensure that he or she can pay the instalments on time. Having a steady employment status is likely to fetch you a <a href=\"/car-loan-interest-rate.html\">lower rate of interest </a>on your car loan.</li><li><strong>Debt-to-income ratio:</strong> The percentage of your income which is spent in repayment of debts is called the debt-to-income ratio. Having a good debt-to-income ratio helps in increasing the chances of lowering the rate of interest on your car loan.</li><li><strong>Loan repayment tenure:</strong> The rate of interest charged on your car loan will also depend on the loan repayment tenure to some extent. Usually, the interest rates are higher for a shorter loan repayment tenure and vice-versa. However, even though the interest rates are lower for a longer loan repayment tenure, you are likely to end up paying more interest by the end of the repayment tenure. Thus, it is recommended to not go for the lowest rate of interest available always. You can use an online <strong><a href=\"/car-loan-emi-calculator.html\">car-loan-emi-calculator</a></strong> to find out the exact interest amount that you would be paying and choose the loan repayment tenure accordingly.</li><li><strong>Negotiating for a lower interest rate:</strong> This is one of the most important tips and most of the time we do not consider this factor at all. Negotiating with your lender might actually help to bring down the rate of interest on your car loan. If you are an existing customer of the bank and have maintained a good relationship, then the chances of the bank considering offering a lower rate of interest on your car loan are higher.</li></ul>"

When you take a car loan, the lender will charge you interest on the borrowed sum of money. The rate of interest that you are charged will affect the cost of your loan. To keep your repayment amount low, it is advisable to opt for a car loan with a low interest rate. Here are a few tips to get a car loan with a low interest rate:</p><ul><li><strong>Purchase a New Car:</strong> Although new cars are often more expensive than pre-owned cars, lenders usually charge a lower rate of interest for new cars, which could help you save money over the course of the loan tenure. Thus, if your budget permits, you should consider purchasing a new car.</li><li><strong>Maintain a Good Credit Score:</strong> A good credit score indicates that you are financial reliable to a lender. Individuals with high credit scores are perceived as more financially reliable and creditworthy. If you have a credit score over 750, it is likely that your loan application will be approved quickly and that you will be offered a reasonable interest rate. On the other hand, if you have a moderate to low credit score, your lender may charge you a high interest rate to offset the risk that they will be undertaking by providing you a loan. Keep in mind that most banks will reject your car loan application if your credit score is too low.</li><li><strong>Compare Before You Purchase:</strong> Given the number of car loans that are available in the market, it is in your best interest to <a href=\"/car-loan-interest-rate.html\">compare the interest rates</a> charged by different lenders before zeroing in on a car loan offered by a particular lender. When comparing loans, it is advisable to check the interest rate offered, the lender's eligibility criteria, the processing fee charged by the lender, etc.</li><li><strong>Pay a Down Payment:</strong> Most lenders offer car loans that will cover anywhere between 80% and 100% of your car's purchase price. While opting for a car loan with full financing may be easier on the pocket, you should keep in mind that you will have to pay a higher interest for the loan, given that you will be borrowing a larger sum of money from the lender. Thus, if possible, you should aim to pay a down payment when purchasing a car on a car loan.</li><li><strong>Check If Your Lender is Willing to Lower the Interest Rate of the Loan:</strong> If you have a prior borrowing history with the lender or have a really good credit score, you can ask your lender to offer you a lower rate of interest.</li></ul>"

The good news here is that car loans are already cheaper than personal loans as they are secured against the value of the car. However, there are still many ways in which you can bring down interest rates even further. Let's check out the simple tips that can help you get the lowest possible interest rate on car loans.</p><ul><li><strong>Improve your credit score:</strong> This is the most important factor for getting competitive interest rates on any kind of loans. Lenders use credit scores to determine the risk profile of an individual. Before you apply for a car loan, you need to improve your credit score to at least 750. You can do this by following a strict financial discipline which includes making your payments on time.</li><li><strong>Maintain a stable income:</strong>Lenders provide loans only to individuals who have a regular source of income. You can avail loans even if you are self-employed by showing a steady income source. Steady income indicates that you can repay the loan EMIs on time. The duration of your employment in a particular job will also influence the <strong><a href=\"/car-loan-interest-rate.html\">interest rates</a></strong> set by the lender.</li><li><strong>Increase your down payment:</strong> There are lenders who offer you competitive interest rates if you increase your share of down payment on a car loan. You can check with the lender regarding this and make the most of a car loan. This also gives additional security to lenders as you stand to lose more in case of a default.</li><li><strong>Compare the offers in the market:</strong> There are multiple lenders in India for car loans. The interest rates and other loan terms do no remain the same for these lenders. Hence, you need to compare the offers of various lenders before choosing the right one suitable for you. You can use BankBazaar website or mobile app to compare the rates of multiple lenders simultaneously.</li><li><strong>Have a low debt-to-income ratio:</strong> Debt-to-income ratio refers to the percentage of income you spend on paying loan <a href=\"/car-loan-emi-calculator.html\">EMIs</a>. Higher the ratio, higher the risk of default according to lenders. Hence, it is necessary to maintain a low ratio to get a good deal on your car loan interest rate. You can maintain a low ratio by clearing off your existing loans before applying for a car loan.</li><li><strong>Negotiate with the lender:</strong> You may also negotiate with the lender to get a good deal on your car loan interest rate. You may use the factors listed above while negotiating with the lender for a deal. While negotiating the interest rate, it is also better to negotiate the charges associated with the loan.</li></ul>"

Hence, it is better to improve your credit score before you apply for a new loan.

Only by knowing this you can fix the issues and become a creditworthy applicant. When you make multiple applications, it will make you seem like you are too desperate for loans.

Similarly, you cannot sell the vehicle before you pay off the loan. You need to get full ownership of the vehicle if you wish to sell or pawn the title of your car.</p>"

The features and benefits of the car loan can also be compared on these sites.</li><li><strong>Make a higher down payment</strong>: The loan amount provided by the lender will decrease if you make a higher down payment.

You can also find out <a href=\"/credit-score.html?variant=slide&utm_source=bb&utm_medium=display&utm_campaign=HEADER&ck=Y%2BziX71XnZjIM9ZwEflsyAwU7nH9yhDPZKPICnKAvRxAevB1eS8eCGuBkX8I0T6I\">your credit score</a> on BankBazaar.

However, it is advisable that the applicant take their time to make their decision. An easy way to do this would be to compare aspects of a car loan like interest rate, processing fee, tenure, etc. of various car loans offered by different banks in Noida. Banking websites like BankBazaar provide all the information that a car loan applicant would require.</li><li><strong>Assess Your Needs:</strong> It is important that the applicant ensures that they do not apply for a car loan that causes a financial strain on the applicant's monthly income. It should be noted that a car is a depreciating asset and applying for a large car loan amount would not be wise if you do not have the monthly income to pay for the EMIs.</li></ul>"

This is simply because a high credit score indicates a high repayment capacity. To keep your credit score healthy, you should check it regularly. Doing so will let you approach the lenders with confidence if you find it above 750 or let you take corrective steps in case you find it to be below the required limit.</li><li><strong>Opt for a shorter tenure – </strong>Apart from helping you save on the interest, opting for a short repayment tenure will aid in you getting a lower interest rate on your car loan. This is because a shorter tenure ensures the loan to be paid off quicker, which is what lenders want and why they are likely to offer you a lower interest rate.</li><li><strong>Ensure a low debt-to-income ratio – </strong>A low debt-to-income ratio means that even after taking care of your monthly debt obligations, you have enough left of your earnings to be able to pay the EMI on your car loan. Hence, if your debt-to-income ratio is low, the chances of the lender offering you a lower interest rate are high.</li><li><strong>Check out all the options and compare – </strong>Most of us, perhaps, have the habit of exploring all the options before you pick a product/service. This is a good habit even in case of car loans as it helps you compare the options and make an informed decision. You can simply pick the lender that offers you the lowest interest, if that's the only thing you are looking for. However, it is a good idea to consider other factors as well.</li><li><strong>Negotiate with the lender – </strong>Having a good credit score and higher income, choosing a shorter tenure, etc., can fetch you lower interest rates if you negotiate with the lender. The likelihood of your existing lender offering a lower interest rate is higher than that of a new lender simply because your existing lender is aware of your past transactions. So, before you approach other lenders, it is a good idea to negotiate for lower rates with your existing lender.</li></ul>"

                        "body": "<p>A low interest rate means that your loan will cost you less. Lenders all over the country charge varying interest rates on their auto loans. Comparing various lenders will help you find the lowest rates in the city.</p><p>But there are a few other things that you can do to get a <strong><a href=\"/car-loan-interest-rate.html\">car loan with the lowest rates.</a></strong> We've put together a list of tips that may be able to help you with this. Take a look at them below.</p><ul><li><strong>Visit a loan aggregator:</strong> An online loan aggregator can help you find the loan you're looking for in a matter of minutes. All you need to do is to provide some of your basic details regarding your place of stay, your current income, and your age. The aggregator will base the search on these parameters and tell you all the loans you're eligible for. This will help you find a loan that has the lowest interest rate.</li><li><strong>A higher monthly income can help:</strong> Your monthly income is an aspect that can help you get a lower interest rate. Lenders normally require applicants to fulfil a minimum income criterion. But having a higher income just may get you a loan with better rates. A higher income means that you will be able to pay back the loan without a hitch. This means a lower risk percentage for the lender resulting in the benefit being passed on to you in the form of lower rates.</li><li><strong>Check your debt-to-income ratio:</strong> This ratio compares your current monthly income to your current outstanding debts. As in, it tells you how much of your current income is being used to repay loans that you've taken. If this ratio is high, it indicates that you already have a lot of debts to pay off. Look at reducing this ratio by paying off as many loans as you can before applying for a vehicle loan. This may help you get a better interest rate.</li><li><strong>Choose your tenure wisely:</strong> The tenure of your loan is one of the factors that determine your EMI. A longer tenure means a lower EMI. Some lenders may also give you a lower interest rate if you choose a longer tenure. However, this would also mean that you will remain in debt for a longer time and you might end up paying more interest in total. When you choose a tenure, make sure it is financially beneficial to you.</li><li><strong>Make larger down payments:</strong> A down payment is the amount of money you bring in when you apply for a loan. Most lenders offer to finance up to 85% of the value of the car. You will have to bring the remaining 15%. Now if you increase your contribution to about 30% or 40%, then you'll have to take only a lower amount of loan. This may get you lower interest rates since the loan amount will be smaller, presenting a lower risk to the lender.</li><li><strong>Have a good credit score:</strong> Your credit score shows lenders how responsible you are when it comes to repaying loans and settling credit card bills. It also shows how responsible you are with your money and how you handle it. A good credit score is what lenders look for since this means the applicant has a low risk of loan default. So, if your credit rating doesn't look good, focus on improving it first. This can help you get lower interest rates.</li><li><strong>Negotiate with your lender:</strong> Sometimes, negotiating can help you in ways that other things can't. For example, if you're expecting an increase in income, you can't put it on paper. But you can communicate this to your lender. Or if you find another lender offering better terms than the one you're already banking with, you can negotiate with your bank for a better deal.</li></ul>"

If you opt for a longer tenure, your EMI amount will be lower. So, if you cannot afford to pay a higher EMI, it is a good idea to choose a longer tenure. However, please be advised that doing so will lower the EMI amount but over the loan tenure, you will end up paying higher interest.</p>"

Instead of applying for a new loan, a top-up loan is easier and quicker as the lender will already have your details and documents. However, lenders will require you to have a clear repayment record for at least 9 months before they can offer you a top-up loan. This condition will vary from lender to lender.</p>"

                        "body": "<p>One of the best ways to find lenders that offer <a href=\"/car-loan-interest-rate.html\">low interest rates</a> involves a thorough comparison of the different car loan schemes offered by various banks. Apart from comparing the loans offered by lenders, you can also push for a lower interest rate on your car loan in Meerut by following these simple tips:</p><ol><li><strong>Keep a high credit score</strong></li><p>One of the easiest ways to qualify for a car loan with a low interest rate is to ensure that your credit score is above 750. Most lenders tend to relax the terms and conditions of a loan for customers with excellent credit history, and this applies not only to car loans, but pretty much all kinds of credit. A high credit score reflects your credit history, and lenders are usually flexible with the interest rates and loan amounts if your credit score is 750 or above.</p><li><strong>Lower interest rates for new car loans</strong></li><p>The interest rates applicable to new car loans are relatively lower in comparison with the interest rates applicable to used car loans. A few lenders tend to offer the same interest rates for the purchase of new cars as well as old cars. Even the margin or down payment associated with used car loans are relatively high in comparison with new car loans. For instance, the margin for new cars can range between 10% and 25% of the price of the car, but for old cars, the margin can be as high as 40%. If you wish to avail a used car loan, make sure you consider various factors such as the age of the vehicle, the interest rates applicable to the loan, and the down payment to be made.</p><li><strong>Lower rates for salaried employees in comparison with self-employed individuals</strong></li><p>Salaried applicants are usually offered slightly lower interest rates in comparison with self-employed applicants. Most forms of credit, be it car loans, home loans or personal loans, can be availed for lower interest rates by salaried customers. The reason why banks and financial institutions offer lower rates to salaried individuals is that they earn a fixed income each month, thereby ensuring that they can make repayments consistently. Self-employed applicants, on the other hand, earn variable income, which makes them slightly more risky customers to the lender in comparison with salaried applicants.</p><li><strong>Women borrowers can avail lower interest rates</strong></li><p>Women applicants in Meerut can avail lower interest rates on car loans when compared to male borrowers. The difference between the interest rates applicable to men and those applicable to women is not too steep, but the discount in rates can help women borrowers save a lot of money in the long run. If you are a woman who is seeking a car loan in Meerut, there are several different banks and financial institutions that offer discounted rates, thereby making it easier for you to achieve your dream of owning your own car.</p><li><strong>The longer the tenure, the lower the interest rates</strong></li><p>The interest rate applicable to a loan is one of the most important factors that are taken into consideration by those who apply for a loan. Usually, a longer tenure translates to lower interest rates. One of the main advantages to taking a loan with a longer tenure is that your EMIs will be smaller, but the problem with longer tenures is that the amount of money you pay towards the interest component of the loan is quite significant.</p></ol>"

                        "body": "<p>The interest rate that you are charged by a lender when taking a loan can significantly impact the overall cost of the loan. If you are charged a <strong><a href=\"/car-loan-interest-rate.html\">low interest rate</a></strong>, the amount that you will need to pay as interest over the course of the loan tenure will be lesser, and vice versa. Given this, it is essential to secure a car loan with a low interest rate. Thus, we've listed a few tips to help you get a low interest rate when applying for a car loan:</p><ul><li><strong>Maintain a Good Credit Score:</strong> Loan providers usually check your credit score before approving your loan application. Individuals with good credit scores are likely to get charged lower interest rates. Thus, you should check your credit score before applying for a car loan. If your credit score is low, it is advisable to take the necessary measures to improve your credit score. Ideally, to get a loan at a reasonable interest rate, you should have a credit score over 750.</li><li><strong>Look for Special Schemes:</strong> Certain lenders have special loan schemes, wherein select borrowers, such as women borrowers, applicants who are employed in a particular organisation, individuals who have already opened an account with the lender, etc., can benefit from a lower rate of interest. Therefore, you should check the various loan schemes that are offered by different lenders.</li><li><strong>Compare Loans:</strong> To get a loan with the best terms and an affordable interest rate, you should compare the various loans offered by different lenders. You can do this effortlessly through an online aggregator such as BankBazaar.com. On BankBazaar.com, you can check your eligibility and compare the car loans offered by different lenders on a single webpage. Once you find a loan that is well-suited to your requirements, you can directly apply for the loan through BankBazaar.com.</li><li><strong>Check the Loan Term:</strong> Certain lenders fix the interest rate for a loan based on the tenure that you opt for. If you opt for a shorter tenure, you may be charged a higher interest rate, while those who opt for a longer term may be offered a lower interest rate. Keep in mind that although the interest rate charged for a car loan with a long tenure may be lower, you will still have to pay more as interest over the course of the loan tenure.</li><li><strong>Negotiate for a Better Rate:</strong> If you have a good relationship with the lender, have a good credit score, or have previously taken loans from a certain lender, you may be able to negotiate for a better rate of interest. Lenders are likely to charge lower interest if they know you have a good repayment history.</li></ul><p>In addition to the interest rate, banks and financial institutions that offer car loans also levy other charges such as the loan processing fee, documentation charges, penalty charges, pre-payment charges, etc. While it is important to pick a car loan with a low interest rate, it is equally important to check the other fees and charges levied on the loan. These charges can cause the cost of your car loan to increase, even if you are charged a comparatively low interest rate. Thus, it is in your best interest to read through the terms and conditions of the loan and ensure that you are aware of all the charges that are applicable.</p>"

It does not matter whether the loan applicant is working with an organization or is self-employed.</p><p>? A good income level alone is not a criterion that will secure the loan, the applicant also needs to have a good credit rating from a credit bureau that is recognized.</p><p>? While a person can be a resident of a self-owned house or a rented one, they need to have completed one year of residence in the same place prior to applying for the home loan.</p><p>One thing that the loan applicant has to keep in mind is the fact that they can only obtain a loan for about 70% to 80% of the total amount they need to purchase property. They will have to finance the rest themselves.</p>"

                        "body": "<ul><li><u><strong>Credit Clean-up:</strong></u> One of the main factors taken into consideration by lenders is your credit score. Getting a personal loan is easier with a high credit score. If your score is low, you must check your reports to see if there are any errors. Sometimes, simple errors could have an adverse effect on your scores, and if you find any of these, you must report them to CIBIL.</li><li><u><strong>Rebalancing your income and debts:</strong></u> Lenders ask for proof of income when you apply for personal loans in order to ascertain your debt-to-income ratio. Consider the sale of liquid assets like stocks or earning more through a part-time job to increase your annual income. Doing so will increase your debt-to-income ratio and increase your chances of getting a loan.</li><li><u><strong>Consider Co-signers/Guarantors:</strong></u> If you are finding it hard to get a personal loan on your own accord, you can apply for one by adding a co-signer or guarantor. The person you choose as a guarantor must have a good credit score. Their main aim is to guarantee that you will repay the loan. However, they will also be liable to repay the loan themselves if you are unable to do so. Picking an individual with a credit score over 750 will considerably increase your chances of getting a personal loan.</li><li><u><strong>Limit Your Borrowing:</strong></u> It can be risky to ask for more money than you require to meet your financial targets. Make sure that you calculate how much you need and apply only for that specific amount.</li><li><u><strong>Choose the Right Lender:</strong></u> Every lender has their own requirements when it comes to credit scores and income. When looking for personal loans, pick a lender whose eligibility criteria you meet and apply accordingly. The problem with applying with multiple lenders is that each of them will <a href=\"/credit-score.html\">check your credit score</a>, and each time your full credit report is pulled out, your credit score drops, albeit marginally.</li></ul>"

However, that is not the case. There are certain things that you should do after paying off your personal loan.</p><ul><li><strong>The No Dues Certificate or NDC: </strong>The No Dues Certificate or NDC is issued by your lender once you pay off the debt. This is one of the most important documents that you should collect immediately after paying off your loan. It is also a wise decision to retain this document for an extended period of time. This certificate validates the repayment that you have made. Without this document you cannot prove that you have paid off your debts. In case you are looking forward to taking another loan in the near future, you will need this document to prove that your previous loan has been paid off. Usually, this document is issued on spot by your lender if you are paying off the final amount through hard cash. If you are paying via check or NEFT or any other means, the lender will issue the NDC and will either send it to your registered address or will ask you to collect it from the branch office of the lender.</li><li><strong>The Statement of Account or SoA: </strong>The Statement of Account or SoA, along with the NDC will help you prove that your debts have been completely paid off and have been paid on time. This is an optional document which is often issued by certain lenders. If your lender provides this document, you should consider getting it. However, you should also look for any sorts of discrepancies in the credit score. If you find something wrong, you can use the SoA to make the necessary changes to it.</li><li><strong>Collection of unused cheques: </strong>If you have some cheque leaves which have not been used, you should collect those as well. The collection of the No Dues Certificate and the unused cheque leaves, usually, marks the end of the closure process for the loan.</li><li><strong>Check your credit score after closing the loan: </strong>This is just a recommendation. It is not compulsory to check the credit score after the closure process ends. However, it is recommended that you check the score to make sure there are no differences in the score. If there are some chances of you availing another loan within 1 to 2 years of the closure of the current loan, it is highly recommended that you check the credit scores right after the closure of the loan.</li></ul>"

                    "answer": "<p>You borrow a loan when you are in need of credit. Once you submit your loan application to a lender for a personal loan, the lender verifies and approves it. Post this, the loan amount is disbursed into your bank account. Once you receive the loan amount, you will need to repay the lender via EMIs over the course of the loan repayment tenure.</p>"

                    "answer": "<p>A credit score or rating is a number that indicates how you repay debt. It is important because your score determines whether you qualify for loans, credit cards, and other credit facilities.</p>"

                    "answer": "<p>Your credit score is an indicator of how you handle your finances. It considers your credit card bill payment history, repayment of past and current loans, and other criteria. Your credit rating tells lenders how likely you are to repay them if they grant you a loan. The better your credit score, the better the chances are of getting a higher loan amount.</p>"

                    "answer": "<p>If you happen to get some extra money, you can pay it towards your loan even before the EMIs are due. This is called a prepayment. Every prepayment you make goes towards reducing the outstanding principal component of your loan. And since the principal reduces, your interest cost will also reduce. Also, your tenure gets shortened this way, helping you pay off the loan ahead of time.</p>"

                    "answer": "<p>Personal loans are a good option if you need funds for a large expense or wish to consolidate multiple debts. The key benefit of a personal loan is that you can pay monthly instalments to repay your borrowed loan amount. Further, you can also choose a repayment tenure between 1 year and 5 years to suit your repayment ability. Credit cards, on the other hand, are a good choice if you want to finance smaller expenses, provided that you can repay your balance in full at the end of every month.</p>"

Annual fee and joining fee are minimal for the basic credit cards and the more benefits a card offers, the annual and joining fee increases. Many cards offer a waiver of annual fee if you spend a certain sum of money in a year. All in all, the benefits of the card must be greater than the fee of the card.</p>"

Here's a handy list:</p><ul><li><strong>Your spending pattern: </strong>Do you spend more on groceries each month and less on dining? Then get a card that rewards your grocery spends. If a major portion of your income goes towards online transactions, get a card that rewards those transactions.</li><li><strong>The reward type:</strong> Credit cards offer rewards in terms of cashback (which you can use to offset your bill), rewards points (which can be used to redeem lifestyle, travel, retail, and dining vouchers), and air miles (which can be transferred to your preferred airline's frequent flyer programme and help fund the tickets for your next holiday).</li><li><strong>Fees and charges: </strong>Compare the interest rate on different cards and the fees and charges apply. Look for a card whose joining fee and the annual fee you can afford. Also, see if there are any hidden charges.</li><li><strong>Offers on the card: </strong>Some cards have great offers and discounts when you use the card to shop on a particular website or when you use it at a particular store. Some offer great dining discounts and others are better suited for travel. Make sure you go through the offers available on the card before making your decision.</li><li><strong>Welcome bonus or gift: </strong>To get you to apply for their card, banks offer welcome gifts and bonuses. This could be the latest gadget or bonus points and miles. If you are looking to earn rewards at an accelerated pace, look for a card that offers a considerably large welcome bonus.</li><li><strong>Payment options: </strong>Most cards will allow you to make payments via multiple channels. In general, if you tend to forget to make payments by the due date, you should consider having your credit card payments automatically debited from your account.</li></ul><p>If you keep these points in mind, getting the right credit card shouldn't be too much of a problem.</p>"

This doesn't just lead to you having to pay interest, but your credit score ends up taking a hit as well.</li><li><strong>Pay your bills in full:</strong> If you don't pay your bills in full, you lose out in two ways. One - you have to pay interest on the amount you don't pay and two - you lose out on any rewards those transactions earned.</li><li><strong>Redeem rewards:</strong> Redeem the rewards you earn since that is the best way to get the best out of your credit card.</li><li><strong>Check your card statement:</strong> Make it a habit to check your credit card statement each month. This way, you can immediately dispute any transaction.</li><li><strong>Consider not taking a credit card loan:</strong> Credit card loans or cash advances have a high rate of interest and no interest-free period. You are charged interest from the moment you withdraw money up until the time you repay the entire amount.</li></ul>"

As per the new change, the MDR will now be based on the turnover of the merchant/company rather than the current slab-based structure. The MDR is applicable not only for transactions at POS terminals but also for online transactions and QR-based transactions. As already mentioned, merchants/vendors/companies will be charged based on their turnover for the year and are segregated into two categories - merchants with a turnover up to Rs.20 lakh and merchants with a turnover more than Rs.20 lakh. For merchants with a turnover (previous financial year) up to Rs.20 lakh, a limit of 0.40% or Rs.200 will be charged for transactions online or at POS terminals. For QR-Based transactions, the MDR will be capped to a maximum of 0.30% of the transaction or Rs.200. For merchants with a turnover (previous financial year) more than Rs.20 lakh, the applicable MDR for transactions made at POS terminals or online will be limited to 0.90% or Rs.1,000.

Your card is considered authentic only if you fix your signature in the space provided on your card.</li></ul><ul><li>Sometimes fraudsters may jam the Enter and Cancel button in an ATM machine to put your transaction on hold. In such cases, do not leave the ATM counter without cancelling the transaction.</li><li>Make sure that you have memorized your debit card PIN. Do not write down your debit card PIN number anywhere.</li><li>While making a transaction at an ATM counter, make sure that no one else is there with you.</li><li>As an enhanced security measure, keep changing your debit card PIN from time to time.</li><li>If you are withdrawing cash from ATM located in an open space, ensure that you hide the PIN combination while making the entry.</li><li>Dispose of your old debit cards if you are not using them anymore.</li><li>Do not dispose of balance receipt in the ATM counter itself. Hackers and fraudsters can use this information to gain access to your bank account.</li><li>Track your account transactions on a regular basis. This will help you in identifying any unusual activity in your account.</li><li>Register for email or SMS alerts. This will help you in staying up to date with your transactions.</li><li>While transacting at petrol bunks, restaurants, and similar places, ensure that your debit card is swiped in the POS machine only in your presence. Otherwise, there are chances of your information being skimmed. Skimming is the process of duplicating a debit card with the use of a skimming device.</li><li>In case you doubt a skimming device being installed in an ATM machine, refrain from making any transaction and inform the concerned authorities immediately.</li><li>Get your debit card blocked immediately, in case it is lost or stolen. You can do so by calling the bank on their hotline number.</li><li>Whenever you receive an email or a call asking for your account details or debit card information, report the incident to your bank.</li><li>Your bank will never ask for your debit card information. Never share your information with anyone over phone, call, or message, even if the person claims to be from the bank.</li><li>While shopping online with your debit card, make sure that the website of the e-tailer starts with 'http'. This is a sign that the website is secure and genuine.</li><li>Do not save your debit card details on merchant websites for ease of making payments. Because in case the website is hacked, you will be at the risk of losing your baking information to hackers and fraudsters.</li></ul>"

The cashback can be redeemed by the customer and used for future purchases. Different banks offer a wide variety of debit cards. The reward system is generally based on the type of the debit card. Banks often tie up with different retailers for a period of time. Customers are eligible to receive cashback (occasionally other rewards) on the purchase of goods and/or services from these sellers. For example, consider the Big Billion Day sale by Flipkart or The Great Indian Sale by Amazon. During these sales, banks tie up with the seller companies to offer rewards to the debit card and/or credit card users. These rewards are often given in the form of cashback or additional discounts.

There are other factors that also need to be considered like the credibility of the organisation that is offering the term deposit. Preferably, go for 'A' rated schemes and consider rating from organisations like ICRA and CRISIL.</li><li><strong>Tenure:</strong> Another factor that determines the rate of return of your investment is the duration for which the investment is held.</li><li><strong>Interest compounding frequency:</strong> Find out how the interest is calculated on your investment. If you choose to reinvest the interest that you earn, the total return on the investment will be much higher.</li><li><strong>Interest payout option: </strong>See if the FD you are investing in gives you a wide range of interest payout options. Take a look at the frequency on interest payouts. In most cases payments are made monthly, quarterly, annually or half-yearly.</li><li><strong>Penalty rates: </strong>The other thing to check before putting your money in an FD is whether there is any fee levied in case you want to prematurely break your deposit.</li></ul><a href=\"/fixed-deposit.html?variant=slide&WT.mc_id=SEO_ARTICLE&utm_source=bb&utm_medium=seo&utm_campaign=SEO_ARTICLE\" title=\"Apply for Personal Loan\"><img title=\"Apply for Fixed Deposit\" alt=\"Apply for Fixed Deposit\" src=\"/images/india/infographic/apply-for-fixed-deposit-online.png\"/></a>"

Even though silver rates have shown a steady increase over the last two decades, the historical trends should not be taken as a benchmark when considering future price volatility. Investment in silver as a commodity has gained steam in the country, and investors need to factor in various variables if they are to make decent profits from silver in the short/long run.</p><ol><li><strong>Large investors:</strong> The silver market is much smaller than the gold market. As such, large investors or traders can potentially influence silver prices. A point in case here is Warren Buffet buying 130 million troy ounces of silver in 1997 at $4.50/ounce, which impacted market prices.</li><li><strong>Oil prices:</strong> Mining of silver is an energy-intensive process, and so silver prices are correlated with oil prices, the primary energy source in today's world. Also, imported silver requires a strong logistics platform backed by consistent oil supply. Volatility in oil prices cause dynamic prices of both gold and silver.</li><li><strong>Industrial demand:</strong> As India moves towards greater industrialization, the need for silver as an industrial commodity has seen a spike in recent times. This is touted to drive silver prices in the near future and beyond.</li><li><strong>Import duties:</strong> As silver is primarily imported in India, silver rates are directly affected by the import duty applicable on imports. A higher import duty translates to higher silver prices in India.</li><li><strong>US Dollar fluctuation:</strong> Silver prices are inversely affected by the USD Index. This means that a strengthening USD can decrease silver rates in India, while a weakening Dollar signals increasing silver prices.</li><li><strong>Gold prices:</strong> In general, silver prices follow the upward/downward trend of gold closely. If there is a spike in demand for gold leading to increase in its price, silver will follow suit. Similarly, any decrease in gold prices will see a greater decrease in silver prices.</li><li><strong>Trade deficits:</strong> The greater the amount of imported commodities, the more will be a country's trade deficit. As the trade deficit increases, the government may take step in to take counteractive steps to curb import of commodities, such as it did in the last couple of years to rein in gold imports.</li><li><strong>Inflation:</strong> As commodities like gold and silver are preferred choices of customers to hedge their funds in times of financial stress owing to inflation, prices of silver tend to increase when inflation is high.</li><li><strong>Large Concentrated Short Position:</strong>3 or 4 of the largest silver traders currently hold 90% of all short silver contracts. This sort of concentration of a publicly traded commodity in the hands of few can have significant implications on prices of silver in the short and long run.</li></ol><h3>Silver Measurements</h3><p>Silver is measured in troy weight and grams. Silver may sell in troy ounces, million ounces, grams, kilograms, tonnes, short tonne, metric tonnes, tolas etc.</p><p>Silver fineness is measured as the percentage of silver in the resulting alloy. For instance, a fineness of 900 implies 90% silver in the final product. Fineness is the parts of silver per 1000 parts. Usually copper is added to silver to produce more durable coins. Silver may also be measured in carats similar to how gold is measured.</p><h3>Silver Demand in India</h3><p>Silver has the dual usefulness of being a precious metal as well as an industrial metal. World over, silver is primarily traded for its industrial implications, however Indian silver imports are largely for jewelry and silverware. India is among the top 5 silver consumers in the world. About 60% of silver consumption in India is from the rural population who view it as a solid savings commodity.</p><p>India does not produce silver in a significant scale and most of the silver has to be imported from outside the country. Moreover, silver demand has been on the rise in major growing economies like India and China during the past few years. Nascent industries such as medicine, manufacturing etc. are picking up demand for silver, and this may soon translate to higher levels of imports.</p><h3>Silver Commodity Trading in India</h3><p>Silver as a commodity is traded in three commodity exchanges in India:</p><ol><li>Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX).</li><li>National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX).</li><li>National Multi Commodity Exchange (NMCE).</li></ol><strong>MCX</strong><p>Silver is traded in 3 contract types:</p><strong>Silver Mini (SILVERM)</strong><ul><li>Trading units of 5 kg.</li><li>Base value of 1 kg.</li><li>Price quotation: Ex-Ahmedabad.</li><li>Maximum order size of 600 kg.</li><li>Daily price limit of 4%.</li><li>Tick size (minimum price movement) of Re. 1 per kg.</li><li>Upper limit on positions: 60 MT for all silver contracts combined for individual investors. 300 MT or 15% of market wide open positions for a member collectively investing for all clients.</li><li>Purity grade 999 and fineness 999.</li></ul><strong>Silver Micro (SILVERMIC)</strong><ul><li>Trades from Monday to Friday.</li><li>Trading units of 1 kg.</li><li>Base value of 1 kg.</li><li>Price quotation: Ex-Ahmedabad.</li><li>Maximum order size of 600 kg.</li><li>Daily price limit of 4%.</li><li>Tick size (minimum price movement) of Re. 1 per kg.</li><li>Upper limit on positions: 60 MT for all silver contracts combined for individual investors. 300 MT or 15% of market wide open positions for a member collectively investing for all clients.</li><li>Purity grade 999 and fineness 999.</li></ul><strong>Silver 1000 (SILVER 1000)</strong><ul><li>Trades from Monday to Friday.</li><li>Trading units of 5 kg.</li><li>Base value of 1 kg.</li><li>Price quotation: Ex-New Delhi.</li><li>Maximum order size of 600 kg.</li><li>Daily price limit of 4%.</li><li>Tick size (minimum price movement) of Re. 1 per kg.</li><li>Upper limit on positions: 60 MT for all silver contracts combined for individual investors. 300 MT or 15% of market wide open positions for a member collectively investing for all clients.</li><li>Purity grade 999 and fineness 999.</li></ul><strong>NCDEX</strong><strong><p>Silver Futures Contract (SILVERHEDG)</p></strong><ul><li>Trades from Monday to Friday.</li><li>Trading units of 30 kg.</li><li>Price quotation: Ex-New Delhi.</li><li>Maximum order size of 1,500 kg.</li><li>Daily price limit of 4%.</li><li>Tick size (minimum price movement) of Re. 1 per kg.</li><li>Upper limit on positions: 100 MT or 5% of market wide open positions for all silver contracts for clients. 1,000 MT or 20% of market wide open positions for a member collectively investing for all clients.</li><li>Purity grade 999 and fineness 999.</li></ul>"

Central government has taken care to ensure that the scheme has simple Know-Your-Customer (KYC) rules for effective utilisation. The Jan Dhan scheme offers accident insurance up to Rs.1 lakh on one account and a life cover of Rs.30,000 (subject to conditions). An individual can avail of an overdraft facility of up to Rs.5000 upon completion of six months of satisfactory maintenance of the account. Account holders can also avail of RuPay debit card and mobile banking services.</p><p>In case an individual does not produce any ‘valid document’, he or she can open a temporary ‘small account’. However, the concerned account holder should submit any valid document in one year or aadhaar card. According to experts, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will help plug loopholes to rein in fiscal deficit. Also, akin to Direct Benefit Transfer, all proceeds from various government schemes are transferred to beneficiaries’ accounts. There is a view that Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana will rein in black money in the economy.

In fact, the public-sector lender reported a loss of Rs.2,416 crore for the past quarter, in contrast to the net profit of Rs 1,820 crore it made in the same quarter last year.</li></ul><ul><li>However, if we are to look at the bigger picture and consider the 9 month period for the two financial years, we will notice that SBI is still making a profit, although the number has dropped considerably. SBI's net profit, as of December 2017, is standing at Rs.1,171 crore, in comparison to Rs.1,637 crore for the previous financial year.</li></ul><ul><li>The decrease in profit for the past quarter is primarily due to a substantial hit in investment depreciation, hardening of bond yields, higher provisions, and higher corporate slippages.</li></ul><ul><li>At the same time, SBI's net interest income has improved by 5.17% for the Q3 FY18. This is owing to a significant reduction in interest expenses. However, when we consider the bank's income from other sources, chiefly non-interest based, we'll observe that there has been a 29.75% drop in Q3 FY18 over Q3 FY17. The amount for the two periods stands respectively at Rs.8,048 crore and Rs.11,507 crore respectively. This is because of poor gains from the sale of investments.</li><li>The lender's asset quality has also deteriorated over the last quarter. Gross NPAs (Non-performing assets) rose to Rs.1,99,141 crore from Rs.1,86,115 crore, while Net NPA rose to Rs.1,02,370 crore from Rs.97,896 crore.</li></ul><strong>SBI Stock Trends in 2018</strong><ul><li>The opening price of the stock at the beginning of January 2018 on NSE was Rs.310.

In April, the stock price decreased further and was at Rs.244 by the end of the month.</li><li>The price of the stock picked up the pace in the month of May and stood at Rs.266. In June, the scrip increased further and reached Rs.282 by the mid-June however, it declined by the end of the month and was at Rs.258. The scrip gained strength in July and reached Rs.297 by the end of the month.</li><li>In August, the stock price increased marginally and ended the month at Rs.307.</li></ul>$LPD_EMBEDDED_ITEM_STOCK_1<h3>SBI Stock Returns in 2016 and 2017</h3><ul><li>SBI stocks commenced trading on January 1, 2016, at Rs.225 on NSE and BSE. However, over the course of the next few weeks, the SBI share price fell dramatically. When the month came to an end, the SBI shares were recorded trading below Rs.200.</li><li>This was primarily driven by the bank's decision to monetise non-core assets, change in directors, and other factors. At the same time, SBI secured a $500 million loan from Korean EXIM bank and launched its wealth management service. However, it did little to boost the confidence of investors as the SBI share price had plummeted to Rs.184.20 by the end of the month.</li><li>Things didn't change a lot in February either. SBI, in its Q3 FY16 results, announced a 61% dip in net profit. This led to SBI shares take another hit, with the stock price hitting Rs.155 after a selling spree by the investors.</li><li>However, by early March, things had taken a different turn for the investors. On March 2, 2016, SBI share price rose by nearly 9 percent owing to new RBI Basel norms. Furthermore, the bank also got the approval to operate in Myanmar, which took the SBI share price to Rs.187.50 on March 8, 2016.</li><li>The sentiment of the investors had also improved when SBI decided to raise Rs.500 crore through tier-II bonds. In addition to this, the bank also established a separate board for Chinese investors. By the end of March, the bank revised its lending rates based on new methodology - Marginal Cost of Fund Based Lending Rate (MCLR).</li><li>The month of April did not witness any major nosedive in SBI share price on NSE and BSE. Investors were taken aback in May when the government announced that SBI is yet to raise funds worth Rs.15,000 crore from the market and asked the lender to merge five associate banks. By the end of the first week, SBI share price was down to Rs.180.</li><li>The share price took another hit when the bank praised the decision to restrict lending limits for large borrowers. On May 24, 2016, SBI stocks commenced trading at Rs.168.95 on BSE and NSE.</li><li>Thereafter, there was a sharp spike in SBI share price. The price rose steadily due to the upcoming announcement of Q4 and FY16 results. On May 27, when the bank declared its quarterly results, SBI shares hit a high of Rs.202 and closed trading at Rs.195.55 on BSE. This was primarily due to the fact that the lender also declared a dividend.</li><li>In June, SBI shares were being traded above Rs.200, primarily because of the bank's merger with associate banks. With this merger set to improve the bank's market share, investors began buying SBI shares, thus pushing the price higher. By the end of June, the opening price, on average, was more than Rs.215.</li><li>By August, SBI shares were being traded for more than Rs.230. On August 19, 2016, the opening price was Rs.255 and it hit a high of Rs.260, mainly because the SBI board approved the merger with associate banks.</li><li>The onset of demonetisation pushed the stock price even higher. On November 10, 2016, the closing price of SBI stock was Rs.281.30. At the end of the year on December 30, 2016, the share price had gone down to Rs.249.75.</li><li>In January 2017, SBI shares were trading steadily above the Rs.250 benchmark. The trend did not vary significantly in the month of February as well. After the Q3 FY17 results were announced, the SBI share price hit a high of Rs.282.80.</li><li>This terrific run continued in the month of March as well, when SBI announced its plan to complete the merger with six associate banks by the end of June, along with raising its stake in SBI card. By this time, the share price of State Bank of India was hovering around Rs.290.</li><li>The lender extended its rally to the month of May when the Cabinet approved its policy pertaining to non-performing assets (NPA). This resulted in the stock price hitting a 52-week high of Rs.304.90.</li><li>However, the share price failed to stabilise at the Rs.300 benchmark. Throughout the months of May and June, the stock price continued to hover around Rs.290. The change in the directorate, coupled with rising concerns over NPA, did little to earn investors' faith. By early July, the share price was once again down to Rs.274.10</li><li>By mid-July, the share price was once again inching towards Rs.290, primarily driven by updates and the approval of SBI Life IPO by the board. This, coupled with other updates pushed the stock price of SBI to Rs.310.</li><li>Despite this great run, the stock price once again failed to stabilise and fell down dramatically. Q1 FY18 results were announced which reported a massive surge in net profit after the merger. However, this wasn't enough to keep the investors around owing to the change in directorate. As a result, the price went down to Rs.270.45 on September 19, 2017.</li><li>On October 24, 2017, the SBI stock price was recorded to be at Rs.246. However, the price recovered by 3% in late October when the bank announced a deal with Escorts for tractor financing. The very next, the share price hit a daily high of Rs.328.05 and closed at Rs.324.90. This was in anticipation of the recapitalisation package announced by the government.</li><li>From that point on till the end of the year, the share price continued to remain above Rs.300. It ended the year at Rs.309.</li></ul>"

Among all the public sector banks in the market, it is the State Bank of India which leads in the P/E column, followed by Bank of Baroda at 41. This means that for every rupee that SBI currently makes, investors are willing to pay Rs.58 in the present scenario.</li><li>However, the government-owned lender is troubled by NPA related issues, which has been increasing by the year as shown in the recent quarterly updates. This may be because of poor management at macro and micro levels and is something that needs to be rectified in order to boost investor confidence. The recent change in directorship may appear to be a step taken in the right direction, though its true impact will be known in the coming years.</li><li>Higher provisioning is another factor that must be considered when looking at purchasing SBI stocks as a long-term investment. In its Q3 FY18 report, the lender reported a 12.64% increase in total provisions over Q3 FY17 which, in turn, led to a decrease in net profit. Even though the company is still making a profit, investors will not be impressed with a poor showing on other fronts.</li><li>Even though SBI is a government-owned entity and there is very little chance that the bank will 'crash' drastically, it is still better to invest in private banks mainly because there is better governance and the NPAs are lower. Furthermore, over the last five years, SBI stock returns haven't been that impressive when compared to the returns by private banks in the same term.</li></ul>"

Hence, replacing the insurance documents is extremely crucial. </p><p>The good news is that it is not difficult to get a duplicate document from your insurer. Getting a duplicate document is also essential if your insurance document is fully or partially destroyed. You can get the duplicate document through the following process. </p><h3>File a police complaint</h3><p>This is necessary only if you have lost your insurance document. If the document is destroyed, you may go ahead and contact the insurer directly. Filing a police complaint is essential before you visit the insurer to request for duplicate documents. Through this way, you can justify asking for duplicate documents. Also, an FIR from the police is required when speaking to relevant authorities regarding the loss of your insurance document. </p><h3>Place a newspaper advertisement</h3><p>This is a formal procedure while applying for duplicate documents.
