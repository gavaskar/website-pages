As part of the scam, a father-son duo from Ludhiana had got six such cards in their names. The cards were availed by the duo by jumbling up their names and date of births to get multiple PAN cards. However, the address mentioned in the form was the same in all the application forms. </p><p>The duo named Jagmohan Garg and Umesh Garg have firms in Mochpura Bazar under the names of Garg Wool Store and Garg Woolen Mills. Sources in the department have informed that Jagmohan Garg had two PAN cards in their name while his son Umesh Garg had four PAN cards issued in his name. The scam came to notice when a team from the IT department had surveyed two firms which were owned by the brother of Umesh Garg on August 30. The survey found that the businessmen had allegedly deposited Rs.10 crore in different bank accounts during the period of demonetization claiming that the money which was deposited were proceeds from sales. However, when the sales were investigated the transactions were found to be dubious. Given this, the officials of the department suspect that the duo was running a nexus of converting black money of other people during the period of demonetization. The IT department is contemplating imposing a hefty penalty on the father-son duo as well as writing to NSDL and UTIITSL to get access to the identity and address proofs used for availing the multiple PAN cards. </p>

According to a notification issued by the CBDT on April 9, 2018, Form 49A, and Form 49AA will now also have the option of third or transgender, along with 'Female' and 'Male.' Application forms of Voter ID cards and Aadhaar cards already have the option of third gender mentioned in them. Since PAN card is an important financial document, since it is mandatory to avail various financial services like starting a bank account, filing ITR, investing in fixed deposits, among others. Last year, the government introduced Section 139AA of the Income Tax Act that made it compulsory for applicants trying to get new PAN cards to quote their Aadhaar card number from July 1, 2017.</p> <p>Existing PAN cardholders were asked to link it with their Aadhaar to avoid getting their PAN invalid. Since Aadhaar already includes the third gender as an option and PAN so far did not have this option, it made things and process difficult. With the launch of this initiative, it will be easy for PAN cardholders across the country to link it with their Aadhaar cards. </p>
