What is Credit Card? A credit card is a plastic card issued by a bank or a financial institution to borrow funds at the cardholder&#x2019;s convenience. The maximum credit limit is typically pre-set by the bank at the time of card issuance. The cardholders are free to use the available funds as and when required. The maximum amount of funds can be used only for card purchases such as online transactions and offline transactions at merchant terminals. A small portion, however, is reserved for credit card cash withdrawal. The cardholder has the option to repay the borrowed amount within the grace period, during which no interest will be charged, or he/she can opt for revolving credit which allows carrying forward unpaid amount to subsequent months and also charges interest on the same until the due is settled in full. <strong>Know All About Credit Cards</strong>  <li><a href=\"#What_is_Credit_Card\">What is

&#x2013; The rates/fees and charges may be changed by the banks at any time.Various Elements Printed on a Credit CardA credit card might look like any other card with number, logos and other information. But are you aware that each element on a credit card has a purpose? This section will help you understand the significance of each and every element printed on the front and rear side of a credit card.<strong>Let&apos;s discuss the elements on the front-side of a credit card.</strong>  <li><strong>Credit card number: </strong>The 16-digit number is one of the prominent elements of a credit card. If you think it&apos;s a random, machine-generated number, you&apos;re wrong. Each digit or a set of digits of the number not only provide specific information but are also used to identify the authenticity of the card, just by doing a simple math.</li>  <ul>    <li>The first digit of the 16-digit number is the Major Industry Identifier (MII) and indicates a specific industry that issued the card. For banking and financial institutions, the digits 4 and 5 are assigned by the regulatory. Hence most of the credit cards numbers issued in India begin with 4 and 5. While Visa credit cards begin with 4, MasterCard powered card begin with 5. American Express cards, on the other hand, begin with 3.</li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li>The next 5 digits along with the first digit represent the issuer or the bank. They are thus called Issuer Identification Number or Bank Identification Number (BIN). Each bank uses a different sequence of IIN. Hence by looking at the first 6 digits, one can identify the issuing authority.</li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li>The digits 7 to 15 contain the primary account number of the credit card. The number is unique for each cardholder. The number is crucial to identify the customer hence are often masked in all the bank communications.</li>  </ul>  <ul>    <li>The last digit, the 16th, is called the check digit as it is used to check the accuracy of other digits on the card. The last digit can be generated by applying a mathematical formula called the Luhn Algorithm to the previous digits. One wrong number will give a different result and that&apos;s how inaccuracy of the digits will be identified.</li>  </ul>  <li><strong>The logos and names on the credit card: </strong>The next prominent components on a credit card are the issuer&apos;s logo, the name of the card, card networks such as Visa, MasterCard, RuPay, etc., the cardholder&apos;s name, and the validity date.</li>  <li><strong>The chip and the contactless icon: </strong>These are the new entrants, we can say. With the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) mandating the conversion of all magnetic stripe-only cards into EMV-chip-based cards, all the new credit cards issued after 31 January 2016 are chip based. If your card is upgraded, you can see an EMV chip on the front side.</li>Another latest feature that has been introduced by credit card issuers is the contactless payment feature. If your card has the feature, you will find a symbol similar to a Wi-Fi symbol on your card.<strong>Now let&apos;s move on to the back-side of a credit card.</strong>  <li><strong>Magnetic stripe</strong>: Despite the introduction of EMV chip-based cards, the magnetic stripe, which carries all the crucial account information, still exists till the time all the retail terminals in India are upgraded to accept chip-based cards. This means, even though you receive a credit card very recently, it&apos;s likely that you will see both chip and stripe on your card.</li>  <li><strong>CVV: </strong>The CVV or Card Verification Value is a security code that is used as a fraud-prevention tool. The CVV is typically used for online or card-not-present transactions. While VISA and MasterCards have 3 digits in the CVV, Amex has 4 digits.</li>  <li><strong>Signature box, hologram, and others: </strong>The signature box is another security feature on a credit card. Every cardholder needs to sign in the box to make the card legally valid. In case suspicious cases, the signature on the card will be cross verified with other signature proofs the cardholders carry.</li>The hologram is the glittering little sticker that prevents physical copying of the card. It contains various layers with images imprinted at different angles. Its design makes it hard to copy using a scanner or other instrument. Hence, it also acts as another security feature on the card.How to Use a Credit CardThough the primary functionality of a credit card is to use it only for card-only transactions, such as to purchase goods or services at retail merchant terminals or online, the cash withdrawal feature offered on most the cards, allows the cardholders to withdraw a portion of the amount as cash from ATM. However, in both of the cases, the cardholders need a PIN (personal identification number) to process the transaction. The credit card issuers generate a unique PIN for every credit card and share it with the cardholder once the card is issued. Earlier, banks used to send the PIN through PIN mailer. But now they prefer green PINs which are self-generated by the cardholder. The PIN generation process is different for each bank and the same will be communicated to the cardholder once the card is activated. Once you receive the PIN, you can start using your credit card. Especially at POS terminals, you need to input the PIN once your card is dipped/swiped and the amount is entered. While some online transactions may require the PIN, others may ask for other security info such as CVV or one-time password. For ATM withdrawals, you can follow the same process as you do to withdraw cash using your debit card. The same PIN needs to be entered when necessary. Features of a Credit CardBanks offer amazing features on their credit cards. These features vary depending on the card provider and the type of credit card that people purchase. Some of them are as follows:<strong>Reward Points Program:</strong> Most credit cards offer a reward points program, which allows cardholders to earn reward points on every transaction they make using their cards. A few exceptions to it is that fuel transactions, insurance payments, gold or gold jewellery purchases, utility bill payments, cash and EMI transactions are typically not eligible for reward points. The accrued reward points can be redeemed for various options offered in exclusive rewards catalogues provided by the issuers. However, card members need to earn minimum reward points before going for redemption. <strong>Airport Lounge Access:</strong> Complimentary airport lounge access and membership to Priority Pass Program are one of the most common features offered on most credit cards. Though you may not find the features on a basic credit card, most next to basic credit card offers complimentary lounge access with a limited number of visits per year, free membership to airport priority pass programs and others.

However, the grace period is not applicable if the previous month&apos;s due has not been paid in full or if the cardholder has availed the cash withdrawal facility.Credit Card Billing CycleOnce a credit card is issued, 30 days from the date of issuance, the issuer will generate a monthly statement which is also called credit card statement, which shows all the transactions done on the card as transactions debited to the account and any payments made towards the card as credited transactions. The statement will be mailed to the cardholders every month on a predetermined date. However, if the outstanding balance is less than a certain cut-off, say Rs.200, no statement will be generated.The cardmember has a facility of revolving credit in which he/she can pay only the minimum amount due, as printed on the statement, or the total amount due, or anything in between. If the payment is less than the total amount due, the remaining amount will be carried forward to subsequent statements. The carried forward amount will attract interest at the prevailing rate. All the payments, however, should be made on or before the due date to avoid late payment charges.

Card providers allow customers to choose the repayment period for their EMI (Equated Monthly Instalment) plans. Some banks nowadays offer 0% interest instalment payment plans to their credit cardholders. According to this plan, no interest is charged on the monthly instalments, which means cardholders have to pay the principal amount in parts within the tenure they have chosen.Some banks charge a low interest rate on the EMI plans of credit cards. In this case, the EMI amount comprises of the principal amount and the interest rate. So, every month cardholders are supposed to repay this amount, until they clear off their debt. They can calculate their instalment amount per month before applying for the plan by using an EMI Calculator online. This calculator will help them in figuring out how much they will be paying every month if they opted for a certain EMI plan. To use the EMI calculator, they have to simply enter details like the interest rate, principal amount and the tenure in it.Credit Card Interest RatesBanks charge a particular percentage as the interest rate on the borrowed amount and this is applicable if the monthly outstanding amount has not been repaid by the card holder. The interest rate is calculated as the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and always depends on the type of credit card held. The applicable finance charges are determined on a monthly interest rate percentage and is generally calculated on the average daily balance basis for credit cards. While picking up a credit card, customer can always compare the APRs offered on each card and then choose according to their requirements. Customers who can make regular monthly repayments, can choose credit cards with rewards programs and travel loyalty programs. These type of credit cards tend to have a slightly higher APR. If a customer is looking for flexibility with regards to payments and mainly for purchases, then a credit card with a lower APR should be taken. The APR is always determined based on the applicant&#x2019;s credit score by any financial institution. All banks offer an interest free period ranging from 20 to 50 days to credit card holders as an additional feature.Different Types of Credit CardsNot everyone needs a same credit card. While some consider it as a line of credit, a few consider it as an instrument to track their expenses and for some others it&apos;s a way to get best deals on every purchase.Today&apos;s customer-centric market has thus come with a solution for all - A credit card for every need.

Only after ensuring that the applicant has the financial capability to repay the expenses incurred using a credit card, will the bank approve the customer&#x2019;s application.</p></li>  <li>    <strong>Is there a minimum salary criterion required to be met while applying for credit cards in India?</strong>    <p>Yes, in India applicants are required to earn a minimum of Rs 75,000 to 1 Lakh per annum, though this criterion varies depending on the type of the card.</p></li>  <li>    <strong>What does APR refer to with respect to a credit card?</strong>    <p>Annual Percentage Rate (APR) or the &#x2018;&#x2019;cost&#x2019;&#x2019; at which a customer takes credit from a bank, is the simple interest rate charged by a bank on expenses incurred on a credit card for a year.</p></li>  <li>    <strong>Do banks levy any charges for late payment of credit card bills?</strong>    <p>The best mantra while managing a credit card is to &#x2018;&#x2019;Pay as and when you can&#x201D;.

Here are a few factors to consider when you choose your perfect Credit Card.</p>            <p><strong>Interest Rates</strong></p>            <p>Interest on your Credit Card is charged on a yearly basis. It is a fee that you pay for using the card. It&apos;s a good idea to opt for a card with a fixed interest rate that remains the same every month.</p>            <p><strong>Annual Fees</strong></p>            <p>Credit Cards have an annual fee that is charged to the cardholder. Some charges that are included as a part of the annual fee are late payment charges, cash advances, any requests for increased credit limit and balance transfer.</p>            <p><strong>Grace Period </strong></p>            <p>A grace period is the number of days you will get to pay your Credit Card bill after the due date. The grace period is usually 30-50 days to clear any outstanding dues.</p>            <p><strong>Cash Withdrawal </strong></p>            <p>Credit Cards come with an ATM PIN so that you can get cash through your Credit Card from an ATM. But, remember that cash withdrawals on your Credit Card attract high interest rates.</p>            <p style=\"text-align: center;\">Have you found a Credit Card that suits you yet?</p>          </div>        </div>      </div>    </div>  </div></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div><div class=\"row btm-pad\">  <div class=\"col-md-12\">    <div class=\"video-section\">      <iframe class=\"video-frame\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" title=\"how to apply credit card\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8XPdzwIsskQ\">   </iframe>   </div>  </div></div></div>
