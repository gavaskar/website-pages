Here's a handy list:</p><ul><li><strong>Your spending pattern: </strong>Do you spend more on groceries each month and less on dining? Then get a card that rewards your grocery spends. If a major portion of your income goes towards online transactions, get a card that rewards those transactions.</li><li><strong>The reward type:</strong> Credit cards offer rewards in terms of cashback (which you can use to offset your bill), rewards points (which can be used to redeem lifestyle, travel, retail, and dining vouchers), and air miles (which can be transferred to your preferred airline's frequent flyer programme and help fund the tickets for your next holiday).</li><li><strong>Fees and charges: </strong>Compare the interest rate on different cards and the fees and charges apply. Look for a card whose joining fee and the annual fee you can afford. Also, see if there are any hidden charges.</li><li><strong>Offers on the card: </strong>Some cards have great offers and discounts when you use the card to shop on a particular website or when you use it at a particular store. Some offer great dining discounts and others are better suited for travel. Make sure you go through the offers available on the card before making your decision.</li><li><strong>Welcome bonus or gift: </strong>To get you to apply for their card, banks offer welcome gifts and bonuses. This could be the latest gadget or bonus points and miles. If you are looking to earn rewards at an accelerated pace, look for a card that offers a considerably large welcome bonus.</li><li><strong>Payment options: </strong>Most cards will allow you to make payments via multiple channels. In general, if you tend to forget to make payments by the due date, you should consider having your credit card payments automatically debited from your account.</li></ul><p>If you keep these points in mind, getting the right credit card shouldn't be too much of a problem.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"row btm-pad twi-accordion col-md-12\"><div id=\"accordion\" class=\"panel-group\"><div class=\"panel panel-default\"><div class=\"panel-heading\"><h2 class=\"panel-title\"><a href=\"#26Oct16045140\" data-parent=\"#accordion\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" class=\"accordion-toggle collapsed\"><span class=\"fui-plus\"></span>The Interesting Credit Card Interest Rates</a></h2></div><div class=\"panel-collapse collapse\" id=\"26Oct16045140\" style=\"height: 0px;\"><div class=\"panel-body twi-auto-height\"><p>When you don’t pay the total outstanding amount on a credit card by the due date, you’re automatically opting for the revolving credit facility.

Based on the type of credit card you apply for, the income requirement will differ.<li><strong>Type of card:</strong> Premium cards tend to come with a higher credit limit when compared to entry-level cards.</li><li><strong>Debt-to-income ratio: </strong>This ratio compares the total amount of debt you currently have to your total income. The higher the ratio, the more debt you currently have, lower the credit limit, and vice versa.</li><li><strong>Limit on other cards:</strong> If you already own a credit card, the credit limit on your new card may be the same amount.<p><strong>Credit history: </strong>Good credit history means you are financially responsible.

These features vary depending on the card provider and the type of credit card that people purchase. Some of them are as follows:</p><p><strong>Reward Points Program:</strong> Most credit cards offer a reward points program, which allows cardholders to earn reward points on every transaction they make using their cards. A few exceptions to it is that fuel transactions, insurance payments, gold or gold jewellery purchases, utility bill payments, cash and EMI transactions are typically not eligible for reward points.</p><p>The accrued reward points can be redeemed for various options offered in exclusive rewards catalogues provided by the issuers.

Banks offer various balance transfer options to their cardholders allowing them to repay the amount on a monthly basis within a tenure of their choice.</p><p><strong>EMI Conversion:</strong> The feature allows the credit card members to convert their credit card transaction into easy monthly instalments (EMI). They can either choose to convert the total outstanding on their card into EMI, a specific transaction, especially big-ticket purchases into EMI and can also convert merchant transactions into EMI.Generally, these plans have very attractive interest rates and different repayment tenures. The EMI conversion will be done with no other documentation and most of the times instant.</p><p><strong>Lifestyle Benefits:</strong> By partnering with various merchants, credit card issuers provide attractive discounts and offers on various lifestyle categories including dining, shopping, travel, wellness, entertainment, etc.</p><p><strong>Travel Benefits:</strong> Frequent travellers can make the best use of the travel credit cards that provide travel-related benefits to the cardholders.

In most cases, banks will not consider this score to be ideal to offer you a credit card. However, if you have a credit score between 550 and 650, it might be considered poor credit. In these situations, if banks deem you as a responsible borrower, you might be qualified for an unsecured credit card.</p><p><strong>Q.Which is the best and easiest way to get a credit card?</strong><br><strong>A. </strong>The best and the easiest way to get a credit card is to apply for it online from the bank’s website. If you have a savings account in that particular bank, you can also apply for a credit card from your phone through mobile banking.</p><p><strong>Q.Can you use a credit card the same day you get approved?</strong><br><strong>A. </strong>No, you will not be able to use the credit card the same day it gets approved as you will not be given the card on the same day as approval. When your request of the credit card is approved, it takes up to 3 weeks for the bank to dispatch your credit card. This also depends on if you already have an existing relationship with the bank. In that case, you might receive the credit card earlier.</p><p><strong>Q.How can I get a credit card for the first time?</strong><br><strong>A. </strong>If you have an existing score which is above 700, which is a good credit score by banks, your request for a credit card will be approved and the card will be given to you. If you do not have an existing credit score, the bank can offer you a secured credit card if you deposit some money as collateral or if you have a fixed deposit account with the bank.</p><p><strong>Q. What all can I do with my Credit Card?</strong><br><strong>A. </strong>You can use the credit card at the below-mentioned places to conduct transactions – At point of sale (POS) merchant terminals,At ATMs to withdraw cash, On online shopping websites, e-wallets, etc</p><p><strong>Q. Difference between a credit card and a debit card?</strong><br><strong>A. </strong>While a debit card acts as an instrument to withdraw money from your savings account or to make card-based transactions using the amount in your account, a credit card is a credit instrument that allows you to spend using the card and repay it later.</p><p><strong>Q. Should I pay interest on all the purchases I make using a credit card?</strong><br><strong>A. </strong>No, you don't have to pay interest on all the transactions. However, if you're not repaying the due amount within the stipulated time, the unpaid due would attract interest along with all the new transactions, till the due amount is repaid in full.</p><p><strong>Q. Can I use my credit card in other countries?</strong><br><strong>A. </strong>It depends on your card type. If your credit card is accepted globally, you can use it in other countries as mentioned by your creditor. However, a certain fee known as the foreign transaction fee will be charged for all the purchases made abroad.</p><p><strong>Q. Difference between a VISA credit card and a Master Credit Card?</strong><br><strong>A. </strong>VISA and MasterCard are two leading payment gateway providers in India. Any credit card issued in India is either VISA-powered or MasterCard-powered or powered by any other payment network. From the cardholder point of view, there is no much difference. However, VISA and MasterCard may provide slightly different offers on each credit card.</p><p><strong>Q. How many credit cards should I have?</strong><br><strong>A. </strong>The number one should own is not fixed. It depends on your financial ability and your spending behavior. However, ensure to manage all the cards properly. Use them responsibly, repay the outstanding on time and make sure none of them is affecting your credit score.</p><p><strong>Q. How long does it take to get a credit card approved?</strong><br><strong>A. </strong>The banks typically state that they would take 21 days to disburse a credit card. However, depending on the applicant's profile, availability of documents, verification checks, etc., it might also take a little longer than the stipulated time.</p><p><strong>Q. What is a secured credit card?</strong><br><strong>A. </strong>A secured credit card is typically issued against a fixed deposit with the bank. The amount in the FD account serves as a security deposit in case the cardholder defaults on the credit card. Secured credit cards are ideal for those without any credit history and for those who are availing the credit card for the first time.</p><p><strong>Q. What does 'minimum due' mean on a credit card statement?</strong><br><strong>A. </strong>The minimum amount due is the minimum amount a credit cardholder needs to pay in case he/she is not able to pay the total outstanding. It is typically 5% of the total outstanding amount on the card. Paying the minimum amount would save you from the late payment fee.</p><p><strong>Q. Difference between credit limit and cash limit?</strong><br><strong>A. </strong>The credit limit is the total credit allotted for your credit card at the time of issuance. At any given point, you cannot spend beyond that limit.On the other hand, cash limit is the maximum amount of credit available for cash withdrawal on the credit card. Typically, it's a portion of the total credit limit on the card.</p><p><strong>Q. If I make a late payment on my credit card, will it affect my credit score?</strong><br><strong>A. </strong>It depends on various factors &ndash; the number of days late, the number of instances and the amount due. Based on all this your credit card issuer would take a call about whether or not to report the same to the credit agencies. But once reported, it would certainly affect your credit score.</p><p><strong>Q. Do credit cards offer protection against fraud?</strong><br><strong>A. </strong>Not all credit cards do, but there are quite a few credit cards that come with fraud liability protection cover.If your card offers the protection, most of the fraudulent transactions that might happen on the card when it's either lost or stolen will be covered. However, you need to intimate about the loss of the card immediately to the respective creditor.</p></div><div class=\"clearfix\"></div>",

Here's a handy list:</p><ul><li><strong>Your spending pattern: </strong>Do you spend more on groceries each month and less on dining? Then get a card that rewards your grocery spends. If a major portion of your income goes towards online transactions, get a card that rewards those transactions.</li><li><strong>The reward type:</strong> Credit cards offer rewards in terms of cashback (which you can use to offset your bill), rewards points (which can be used to redeem lifestyle, travel, retail, and dining vouchers), and air miles (which can be transferred to your preferred airline's frequent flyer programme and help fund the tickets for your next holiday).</li><li><strong>Fees and charges: </strong>Compare the interest rate on different cards and the fees and charges apply. Look for a card whose joining fee and the annual fee you can afford. Also, see if there are any hidden charges.</li><li><strong>Offers on the card: </strong>Some cards have great offers and discounts when you use the card to shop on a particular website or when you use it at a particular store. Some offer great dining discounts and others are better suited for travel. Make sure you go through the offers available on the card before making your decision.</li><li><strong>Welcome bonus or gift: </strong>To get you to apply for their card, banks offer welcome gifts and bonuses. This could be the latest gadget or bonus points and miles. If you are looking to earn rewards at an accelerated pace, look for a card that offers a considerably large welcome bonus.</li><li><strong>Payment options: </strong>Most cards will allow you to make payments via multiple channels. In general, if you tend to forget to make payments by the due date, you should consider having your credit card payments automatically debited from your account.</li></ul><p>If you keep these points in mind, getting the right credit card shouldn't be too much of a problem.</p>"

A few exceptions to it is that fuel transactions, insurance payments, gold or gold jewellery purchases, utility bill payments, cash and EMI transactions are typically not eligible for reward points.</p><p>The accrued reward points can be redeemed for various options offered in exclusive rewards catalogues provided by the issuers. However, card members need to earn minimum reward points before going for redemption.</p><p><strong>Airport Lounge Access:</strong> Complimentary airport lounge access and membership to Priority Pass Program are one of the most common features offered on most credit cards. Though you may not find the features on a basic credit card, most next to basic credit card offers complimentary lounge access with a limited number of visits per year, free membership to airport priority pass programs and others. With such a feature on credit card, members can enjoy free lounge visits to both domestic and international airports.</p><p><strong>Fuel Surcharge Waiver:</strong> Another common aspect offered on most credit cards is the fuel surcharge waiver facility that waives off the 1% surcharge that is typically charged on all card transactions conducted at petrol stations.</p><p><strong>Insurance Coverage:</strong> While some premier cards provide a comprehensive insurance policy that provides coverage against air accident, life, lost baggage, lost card, outstanding, etc. On other cards, the cover is limited to a few aspects.</p><p><strong>Global Acceptance:</strong> Today, most credit cards that are issued in India are international cards and are accepted by various merchants all over the world.</p><p><strong>Balance Transfer:</strong> Credit cardholders can transfer the outstanding balance of their existing cards issued by one bank to the credit card account of another bank. Doing so helps them in saving money and repaying the amount at a low rate of interest. Banks offer various balance transfer options to their cardholders allowing them to repay the amount on a monthly basis within a tenure of their choice.</p><p><strong>EMI Conversion:</strong> The feature allows the credit card members to convert their credit card transaction into easy monthly instalments (EMI). They can either choose to convert the total outstanding on their card into EMI, a specific transaction, especially big-ticket purchases into EMI and can also convert merchant transactions into EMI.Generally, these plans have very attractive interest rates and different repayment tenures. The EMI conversion will be done with no other documentation and most of the times instant.</p><p><strong>Lifestyle Benefits:</strong> By partnering with various merchants, credit card issuers provide attractive discounts and offers on various lifestyle categories including dining, shopping, travel, wellness, entertainment, etc.</p><p><strong>Travel Benefits:</strong> Frequent travellers can make the best use of the travel credit cards that provide travel-related benefits to the cardholders.

In most cases, banks will not consider this score to be ideal to offer you a credit card. However, if you have a credit score between 550 and 650, it might be considered poor credit. In these situations, if banks deem you as a responsible borrower, you might be qualified for an unsecured credit card.",
                                    "answer": "Q.Which is the best and easiest way to get a credit card?A. The best and the easiest way to get a credit card is to apply for it online from the bank's website.

No, you will not be able to use the credit card the same day it gets approved as you will not be given the card on the same day as approval.

If you have an existing score which is above 700, which is a good credit score by banks, your request for a credit card will be approved and the card will be given to you.

However, if you're not repaying the due amount within the stipulated time, the unpaid due would attract interest along with all the new transactions, till the due amount is repaid in full.",

                                    "answer": "Q. Difference between credit limit and cash limit?A. The credit limit is the total credit allotted for your credit card at the time of issuance.

        "oldPrimaryContent": "<p>Permanent Account Number or PAN, as it is commonly called, is a means of identifying various taxpayers in the country. PAN is a unique identification number assigned to Indians, mostly to those who pay tax. The PAN system of identification is a computer-based system that assigns unique identification number to every Indian tax paying entity. Through this method, all tax related information for a person is recorded against a single PAN number which acts as the primary key for storage of information. This is shared across the country and hence no two people on tax paying entities can have the same PAN.</p><p>The idea behind PAN is similar to the Social Security Number or SSN used in the United States. SSN in the US is a unique nine-digit number issued to all citizens of the US, permanent and temporary both. Although, the primary aim for SSN creation was to track individuals for social security purposes, it has now become a primary identification number for taxation processes.</p><p>Any PAN issued is valid for the entire lifetime of the PAN holder. This is so majorly because PAN is unaffected by any change of address of the PAN cardholder.</p><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-5\"><table class=\"table table-curved\" style=\"margin:0;\"><tbody><tr><td><p><a href=\"#History_of_PAN_in_India\">History of PAN in India</a></p><p><a href=\"#PAN_Card_Application\">PAN Card Application(Online/Offline)</a></p><p><a href=\"#Documents_required_for_PAN\">Documents Required for PAN Card</a></p><p><a href=\"#Tracking_PAN_Applications_and_Transactions\">Tracking PAN Applications and Transactions</a></p><p><a href=\"#Structure_of_PAN\">Structure of PAN Card</a></p><p><a href=\"#Types_of_PAN_Cards\">Types of PAN Card</a></p><p><a href=\"#Why_is_PAN_important\">Why is PAN important?</a></p><p><a href=\"#PAN_Card_FAQs\">PAN Card FAQs</a></p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>New Design for PAN Card</h2><p>The Income Tax Department has prescribed a new format for PAN Cards issued after 1st January, 2017.

However, the number was not unique at the country level. In the year 1972, the concept of PAN was rolled out by the Indian government and was made statutory under section 139A of the Income Tax Act, 1961.</p><p>The GIR number was allotted by the Assessing Officer to a tax payer and it included the Assessing Officer’s information as well.</p><p>Another problem with the GIR system was that it was not a unique number. A GIR was unique only in that particular ward/circle, resulting in errors or the chances of miscalculations during tax assessment.</p><p>The PAN card in its present form was first introduced in 1972, as a way to overcome these problems. Initially a voluntary process, it was made mandatory for all tax paying individuals in the country in 1976.</p><p>The initial PAN number allotments were made manually, and to avoid duplication, each ward/circle received a certain set of numbers. This series was abandoned in the year 1995 due to a host of problems associated with it.</p><p>In spite of these changes, the first avatar of the PAN card met with some difficulties, as mentioned below:</p><ul><li>There was no database to maintain records of the PAN number allotted, with very limited information being recorded.</li><li id=\"PAN_Card_Application\">There was no centralised authority who issued the PAN cards, resulting in the possibility that different centres could allot the same number to different individuals in the country.</li><li>The PAN card number was not a permanent one as the number changed depending on the holder’s address.</li></ul>$LPD_EMBEDDED_ITEM_PAN<h2>PAN Card Application</h2><p>As mentioned in the section above, <a href=\"/pan-card/pan-card-application.html\" title=\"PAN Card Application\">PAN Card Application</a> can be made either online at the NSDL website or by applying at any of the district level PAN agencies. Applications for new PAN allotment as well as those for correction or change of information can all be made by customers. Form 49A is the form that needs to be filled and submitted for application of new PAN.</p><p>Additionally, there are ways to obtain duplicate PAN card in situations where an entity loses or misplaces the PAN card. Indians, foreigners and NRIs all can obtain PAN, although the forms and procedure may vary for each of these entities.</p><p>Application forms for new PAN and reprint of PAN are different. Once, a user makes any of the above applications with regards to PAN, he/she can <a title=\"PAN Card Status\" href=\"/pan-card/pan-card-status.html\">track the status of PAN</a> application via the acknowledgement number furnished by NSDL.</p><p>A PAN card can be applied for through the NSDL (National Securities Depository Limited) as well as through the UTIISL (UTI Infrastructure Technology and Services Limited).

This document is an extremely important proof of identity. However, in case someone loses or damages their PAN card, the steps below should be followed in order to procure a <a title=\"Duplicate PAN Card Application\" href=\"/pan-card/duplicate-pan-card.html\">duplicate PAN card</a>.</p><ul><li>Applicants must visit the official web portal of NSDL and apply for a 'PAN Change Request' form and fill in all the details.</li><li>If applicants wish to procure a new card without changing any details or the PAN number in case they have lost or damaged their original card then after filling all details, they should not select any box on the left of the margin.</li><li>As long as there are no changes to be made in the PAN card, their address will be updated in the database of ITD based on the address provided in the form.</li><li>Once this is done, they will have to submit a document of identity proof such as passport or Aadhar number, a document for address proof such as Voter's ID or utility bills, along with proof of issuance of PAN number such as a photocopy of the damaged/<a title=\"Reapply for a lost PAN card\" href=\"/pan-card/lost-pan-card.html\">lost PAN card</a> and submit the form.</li><li>A nominal fee will have to be paid online either through credit card/debit card or net banking after which they will receive an acknowledgement through which they can track the status of their application.</li></ul><h2>PAN Card Application Do’s and Don’ts</h2><ul><li>Remember to fill in all the details as per the identity and address proof documents you are submitting.</li><li>Do get thumb impression attested by a Magistrate/Notary before submitting the form to avoid disqualification.</li><li>Write the complete address and provide accurate contact details in the form.</li><li>Do fill in the application form in capital letters.</li><li id=\"Documents_required_for_PAN\">Don’t make corrections or over write anywhere on the form.</li><li>Do not use initials in the first name or last name columns.</li><li>Do not apply for a new PAN card if your old PAN card is lost/stolen/defaced.</li></ul><h2>Documents required for PAN</h2><p>Certain basic documents for proof of address and identity proof are required to be furnished by the PAN applicant. NSDL verifies this information with their central database and rejection of PAN applications is not an uncommon thing when information furnished is incorrect or incomplete.</p>$LPD_EMBEDDED_ITEM_PAN_3<h2>PAN Card Forms</h2><ul><li>There are two types of forms for a PAN Card-</li><li>Form 49A- Form 49A is the PAN Card Application form for all Indian citizens, whether they are residents of India or not. NRI (Non Resident Indians) can also apply for a PAN card using this form.</li><li>Companies, firms, NGO (Non-Governmental Organisations), partnership firms, local bodies, trusts etc. also have to submit Form 49A when applying for a PAN card.</li><li><a title=\"Minor Pan Card\" href=\"/pan-card/minor-pan-card.html\">PAN cards for minors</a> and students have to be applied by submitting Form 49A as well.</li><li id=\"Tracking_PAN_Applications_and_Transactions\">Form 49AA- this form is to be submitted by foreign nationals who are pay tax in the country. Limited Liability companies, firms, trusts, Body of Individuals and Association of Persons registered outside India are to submit Form 49AA duly filled in and signed when applying for a PAN card for tax purposes in India. OCI (Overseas Citizen of India) and NRE (Non Resident Entity) individuals will have to apply for a PAN card using this form.</li><li>Entities applying for a PAN card by submitting form 49AA will have to submit their <a href=\"/passport/oci-pio-card.html\">passport/OCI/PIO cards</a> in addition to bank account statements from their resident country as proof of address and identity.</li></ul><h2>Tracking PAN Applications and Transactions</h2><ul><li>The government has recently unveiled a programme by which it can track transactions made through a PAN card for the purpose of calculating tax. Known as the Income Tax Business Application-Permanent Account Number or ITBAN-PAN, it will enable the Income Tax Department to track every transaction made where a particular PAN number was quoted.</li><li>All financial transactions such as mergers, acquisitions, liquidation, and amalgamation of PAN as well as dissolution information where a particular PAN card was quoted can be traced through the software.</li><li>All existing PAN information and the entire database of PAN information has also been moved to this software.</li></ul><h2>Issuing of PAN Card</h2><p><strong>PAN issuing authority</strong></p><p>Authorized PAN agencies at district level and NSDL (National Securities Depository Limited) are the two issuing authorities that look into PAN applications. Therefore, anyone looking to obtain PAN can either apply physically at any of these district level PAN agencies or <a href=\"/pan-card/about-nsdl.html\">apply online at the NSDL website</a>.</p><p><strong>PAN Allotment</strong></p><ul><li>PAN is issued to customers when they submit their PAN applications via filled <a title=\"Pan Form49A\" href=\"/pan-card/pan-form49A.html\">form 49A</a>. Assessing officers assess the application details using AIS system on computer and after a round of basic verification, the application is sent to the computer centers, where date is entered using the IPAN system and is then transferred to the central data system in Delhi. Since, central data is with National Computer Center, the taxpayer database is checked for information verification. In case, there is no record of PAN allotted to an entity in the past, then the PAN request is accepted and PAN is allotted.</li></ul><ul><li>The above mentioned method is when batch allocation of PAN is done through IPAN. Another way is to allot PAN online through AIS. In this method, customer submits form 49A to the Assessing Officer, who does the data entry and verification and sends it to the National Computer Centre which does PAN allocation and sends it back to the AO who in turn send these details to be printed and passed on to the PAN applicant.</li></ul><p><strong>Operating model</strong></p><ul><li id=\"Structure_of_PAN\">The process of issuing of PAN works on the PPP model which is Public Private Partnership model. This is so for reasons of economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the PAN issuing model. Income tax department has involved two reputed entities, the NSDL and the UTIITSL (UTI Infrastructure Technology Services Limited) for processing of PAN applications as well as collecting, handling and verifying of personal documents.</li></ul>$LPD_EMBEDDED_ITEM_PAN<h2>Structure of Pan Card</h2><p>Permanent Account Number is effective because of its uniqueness. It is an interesting thing to learn about the structuring of PAN. There is a lot of hidden information that goes into the making of the Permanent Account Number.</p><p>PAN is generated automatically by the online system by taking into account the information furnished by the PAN applicant.</p><ul><li><p>First Three Characters</p><p>The first three characters of PAN are a sequence of alphabets from AAA to ZZZ</p></li><li><p>Fourth Character</p><p>The fourth character signifies the type of taxpayer that you are.</p></li><ul><li>A — Association of Persons (AOP)</li><li>B — Body of Individuals (BOI)</li><li>C — Company</li><li>F — Firm</li><li>G — Government</li><li>H — HUF (Hindu Undivided Family)</li><li>L — Local Authority</li><li>J — Artificial Judicial Person</li><li>P — Individual</li><li>T — AOP (Trust)</li><li>K — Krish (Trust krish)</li></ul><p>So if an individual obtains PAN, his/her PAN will have the fourth character as ‘P’ which stands for individual taxpayer.</p><li id=\"Types_of_PAN_Cards\"><p>Fifth Character</p><p>The fifth character in PAN is the first letter of your surname. So, if a person is named ‘Rajesh Khanna’, the fifth character of his PAN will be ‘K’</p></li><li><p>Last Character</p></li></ul><h2>Types of PAN Cards</h2><p>The Income tax Department has mandated that all tax paying entities register and possess a PAN card. While this applies to individuals, companies, partnership firms, NGO’s as well as foreign firms also come under the purview of this directive.</p><p>As a result, PAN cards are issued for individuals as well as companies.</p><strong>PAN Card for Individuals</strong><p>A PAN card for individuals is used to keep track and link all financial transactions that attract tax, with the IT department calculating the total taxable amount due on the basis of this data.</p><strong>PAN Card for Companies</strong><p>A PAN card for organisations is similar to that for individuals, with the exception that there is no photograph on the physical PAN card. Also in lieu of the date of birth mentioned on individual PAN cards, the date of registration of the company/organisation is mentioned.</p><strong>PAN for foreign citizens in India</strong><p>All foreign citizens who wish to carry out business in India are required to obtain PAN. The procedure for doing so is same as applicable to resident Indians. However, the application <a href=\"/pan-card/pan-form49AA.html\">form for foreigners is form 49AA</a> . All entities that are eligible to obtain PAN as Indian citizens are also eligible to obtain PAN as foreign citizens. This list includes entities like HUFs, individuals, trusts and so on.</p><p>The IT Department calculates the amount of tax the company/organisation is required to pay through its various transactions, all of which now require quoting the PAN card.</p><h2>Old PAN Series</h2><p>The first series of PAN was launched in the country, in the year 1972. However, there were certain issues with that series which resulted in the issuing of the current PAN structure than we have.</p><ul><li>A central database was not maintained and hence, there was absolutely no way to verify multiple PAN allocation to a taxpayer</li><li>The data that was stored for PAN holders was neither structured well nor did it capture detailed information except a few primary details like name, address etc.</li><li>PAN was not a permanent number since it depended upon the jurisdiction of the assesse and hence changed when the assesse changed his/her location</li></ul>$LPD_EMBEDDED_ITEM_PAN_1<h2>New PAN Series</h2><p>The old method of registering taxpayers which involved the General Index Register Number or the GIR was replaced by Permanent Account Number in the year 1972. However, this was the old series of PAN which still needed some improvements and had drawbacks as listed in the section above. Hence, in the year 1995, under an amended section 139A of the Income Tax Act, the new series of PAN was rolled out by the Income Tax Department.</p><p>The new PAN series facilitated the following points which were earlier not included in the old series of PAN –</p><ul><li>Linking of all tax related information, current as well as past, to a single identification number</li><li id=\"Why_is_PAN_important\">Easy retrieval of information from the central database. This is because with the launch of the new PAN series, the segregation and recording of data was done more effectively</li><li>Matching all financial information mapped against a single PAN, so that all loan details, credit and debit details as well as investment details could be tracked to a single customers and thereby reining in tax evasion</li></ul><h2>Why is PAN important?</h2><p>A PAN card is a document that no taxpayer can do without. Besides being compulsory in order to file your Income Tax returns and to receive a tax refund, a PAN card also serves an accepted proof of identity and has now been made mandatory for a number of transactions of both a business as well as a personal nature. A comprehensive list of the various activities that require a PAN card to complete or authenticate the activity are mentioned below:</p><h2>Mandatory uses of PAN</h2><ul><li>PAN needs to be quoted while paying direct taxes</li><li>While registering a business, PAN information needs to be mandatorily furnished</li><li>Taxpayers need to input their PAN when paying income tax</li><li>A lot of financial transactions require PAN information. Some of these transactions are:<ul><li>Sale or purchase of property (immovable) which is valued at Rs.5 lakh or above</li><li>Sale or purchase of a vehicle except a two-wheeler</li><li>Payments that are made towards hotels and restaurants and which are above Rs.25,000</li><li>Payments made in connection with travel requirements to other countries. The amount in this case if it exceeds Rs.25,000, then an individual needs to quote his/her PAN</li><li>Making payments of more than Rs.50,000 towards bank deposits in a bank</li><li>Acquiring bonds by paying an amount equal to or greater than Rs.50,000</li><li>Payments made for more than Rs.5 lakhs towards purchase of jewellery and bullion also require PAN information of the purchaser to be furnished</li><li>Any purchase of mutual fund schemes</li><li>Any amount greater than Rs,50,000 used towards purchasing shares</li><li>Any payment of more than Rs.50,000 made towards acquiring an insurance policy needs PAN information of the policyholder</li><li>To Remit money out of India</li><li>Pan information is required for transfer of funds from NRE to NRO account</li></ul></li></ul>$LPD_EMBEDDED_ITEM_PAN_3<h2>General uses/advantages of PAN</h2><ul><li>Since PAN card contains information like Name, Age and photograph, it can be used throughout the country as a valid identity proof</li><li>PAN is the best possible way to keep track of your tax payment. Otherwise, you might be required to pay it multiples times since your tax payment cannot be verified</li><li>Since, PAN is unique for every entity and hence, misuse of the same is almost impossible for purposes of tax evasion etc.</li><li>PAN card can be used as a document that is required to avail connections like electricity, telephone, LPG and internet.</li><li>PAN is a unique identification number assigned to taxpayers and hence it is used to track all financial information like payment of taxes, investments made and debt liability of an entity, to a single customer.</li></ul><h2>Concepts Similar to PAN Card</h2><p>The concept of a PAN card, or a unique number assigned to every tax paying entity is not a new concept. In fact, there are a number of similar such utilities that are used for tax purposes.</p><p><em><strong>TAN (Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number</strong></em>) - This is a unique 10 digit number that is issued to individuals and entities who have to collect or deduct tax on payments they made as part of tax Deducted at Source (TDS) under the Income Tax Act.</p><p>The TAN has to be quoted when applying for TDS or Tax Collected at Source (TCS) challans made to disburse the refund as well as on certificates. Failure to quote the TAN would result in a fine of Rs. 10, 000.</p><p><em><strong>TIN (Taxpayer Identification Number</strong></em>) - A TIN number is a unique 11 digit number that is used to identify dealers who are registered under the Value Added Tax. Allotted by individual states, it is compulsory for all manufacturers, traders and dealers to register for a TIN number. This number is to be quoted when generating invoices, orders or quotations by both the issuing as well as the receiving company.</p><p>It is also used to identify assesses under the Income tax Act of 1961.</p><h2>Who is allotted a Permanent Account Number?</h2><p>PAN is allotted to people who fall under any of the following categories.</p><p>Under section 139A of the <a href=\"/tax/income-tax-act.html\">Income Tax Act</a>, following are the taxpaying entities that are required to have a Permanent Account Number:</p><ul><li>Any person who has paid tax or is liable to pay tax to the Income Tax Department</li><li>Any person who is carrying out a business or professional practice which earns him an yearly turnover of Rs,5,00,000 or more in the previous year of assessment</li><li>All kinds of trusts in the country</li><li>Importers and exporters who are liable to pay any form of tax or duty charges as per the Income Tax Act or as per any other law, currently in force</li></ul><p>PAN is supposed to be applied for by all tax paying entities including individuals, HUFs, partnerships, companies, body of individuals, trusts etc. Also, PAN is furnished by the Income Tax Department for other similar entities like minors, judicial persons, firms, Krish etc. Also.</p><p>At the time of allotment of PAN to an entity, PAN card too is furnished by the Income Tax Department. While PAN is a unique identification number, PAN card is a physical card that has your PAN details as well as name, age and photograph. Copies of this card are submitted by entities for various transactions when required.</p><h2>What Happens If I Don't Have a PAN Card?</h2><p>If your income falls into a taxable bracket, not having a PAN card would result in:</p><p>You paying a flat 30% tax on your earnings and wealth, as stipulated by the Income Tax Department of India. This rule applies to individuals, companies and all entities eligible for tax, including foreign nationals and firms registered outside India.</p><p id=\"PAN_Card_FAQs\">Not having a PAN card will mean you will be unable to purchase a motor vehicle, buy immovable property worth over Rs. 10 lakh, and open an account with any bank in the country among other activities.</p><p>Businesses too will be charged TDS at a flat 30% and will be unable to conduct a large chunk of their activities since quoting PAN has now become mandatory for everything from purchasing land in India to rendering any sort of professional services in the country.</p><h2>PAN Card FAQs</h2><ol><li><strong>How do I apply for a PAN Card?</strong><p>You can submit an application for PAN Card either online at the NSDL website, https://tin.tin.nsdl.com/pan/ or through any of the NSDL PAN Centres/TIN Facilitation Centres.

PAN is a unique identification number assigned to Indians, mostly to those who pay tax. The PAN system of identification is a computer-based system that assigns unique identification number to every Indian tax paying entity. Through this method, all tax related information for a person is recorded against a single PAN number which acts as the primary key for storage of information.
